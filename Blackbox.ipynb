having the freedom to read, listen, and watch what we like. How would you feel if that freedom was taken away from you?  Some people believe that censored books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries. I believe you should have the right to read, listen, and watch whatever you choose, but children should talk to their parents about it first if it is a censored material.      We all know that not everything is okay for certain age groups to read, see, or listen to. That does not mean that the item should be removed completely though. Instead, the child should talk to a parent about the censored item. The parent can decide if the child is mature enough for the item. Also, if those materials are removed from libraries completely, someone that is mature enough to be reading, listening, or seeing it will not have a chance to.      I remember when I was in middle school, I really wanted to read @PERSON1 novels that I saw at the library. My mother believed that I should not read those novels at that age. My mother and I worked out a compromise that I could read @PERSON1 novels that she approved of. She said when I was older, I could read any of @PERSON1's novels that I wanted. I found this compromise to be very fair. I knew that when I was old enough to read those novels, they would still be there on the shelf waiting for me.     We should have the right to read, listen, and watch what we enjoy, but younger children or other age groups should be monitored. That does not mean we need to completely remove those materials from libraries though. When those children are old enough to read, watch, or listen to those materials, they should be able to go to the library, knowing it will be there on the shelf waiting for them.\"\n"," \"Do you believe that certian materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, no i do not. it is one thing to censor a book or movie, but to completley remove it is another. I feel like authors, artists, musicians, and writers should have the freedom to write and say what they want. Regardless of who is reading it.     I feel like censorship is wrong. Authors should be able to feel free to express there thoughts and feelings about a subject or topic in any way they like. some times storys cannot be explained or told the way it needs to be without certain words. Wether those words be good or bad i feel like with out them the book that is being read is not all of what it could of been. in my oppionion censorship takes away from certain values or qualitys the book could of had with the original context still in it. and to me that is not fair. its not fair to the author. and is most certainly not fair to the reader who is reading the book.     I know from my personal expierences with reading books that 'yes' i have read books that have had bad language in them. but just because a book has one or two bad words in it does not mean that it should be completley taken off the shelf. For example the book '@CAPS1' @CAPS2: @PERSON1 was an amazing book. I probably enjoyed that book more than i have any other book that i have ever read in my entire life. But that book would not be nearly as good as it was with it being scensored or taken off the shelf for that matter.     All i am trying to get at is that good books with bad language should not be censored just because of some of the words it has in it. because that is getting away from what the over all message is about. Your almost taking the words out of context when you do this. Do i believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive? No i do not. Neither should you\"\n"," \"Sexual conduct, language, and criminal behavior are three big things in my school, and community. Certain books, movies, music, and magazines are all about those three things. If they are in our libraries, how can teachers and administration keep us from it during school? I think the censorship of some movies, magazines, and especially music should be highly discussed, and more strict.     We do not really have a lot of movies in our school library, but I do know that there are some in the town library. Parents and adults do not want us growing up so fast, and yet they allow sexual, crude language movies to be on the shelves of libraries. If it is such a big deal, I think they need to be removed. I'm a big believer on the fact that if it happens, it is going to happen no matter @CAPS1 precautions are taken. But with that said, we can still take the needed precautions to keep it from kids that are too yound to see them, like under the age of @NUM1. It is not just movies that we have to worry about though.     @ORGANIZATION1 is a magazine that is devoted to giving their readers tips on sex, problems with their sex lives, and the occassional '@CAPS1 to wear this @DATE1!' articles. I will say that I have read this magazine, but it doesn't appeal to my interests. Some kids today though, are very attentive to those subjects. Again, that goes back to the problem of kids growing up too fast. I have noticed in my school alone, that it is a rapidly growing problem. If magazines like this weren't on the shelves for us to see whenever we enter a library, maybe we would not be as keen to the idea. If we were not introduced to it so early, we would not be going behind our parents' backs trying to do it. @ORGANIZATION1, and other magazines like it, needs to be taken off the shelves as soon as possible. Music is a world-wide phenomenon.     Say a child around the age of @NUM2 is listening to the new @CAPS2' @PERSON1 song. He is being introduces to crude language, sexual behavior, and criminal acts in the @NUM3 minute time period it takes to listen to the full song. Seriously, it only takes that long for a child to be introduced, and it is only one song out of the thousands that are out there. This music is able to be accessed on many computers, especially in public, town libraries. We are not allowed to act like that in school, and if we are going to be spending @NUM4 of our childhood/teenage years here, why let us listen to it? If you walk into a library, all you have to do is sign your name, the date, and the time you got there to access a computer. After that, they can not tell you to get off of it, unless you are violating the law or looking up something not age appropriate. Music does not fall into that category. It, too needs to be taken away if the language, sexual conduct, and criminal behavior messages are adult rated.     I, personally, love magazines, movies, and music. They are my three m's and I live by them. But not the ones that are going to get me in trouble, put wrong messages in my head, or cause me (subconciously) do participate in a criminal act. I always allow my mother or father to read books, listen to music, and watch movies with me. If they are not pleased with @CAPS1 it is, I will not do it behind their back. The censorship in libraries needs to be more strict. If it were more strict, it would keep our younger children from growing up to fast and keep teens from participating in criminal acts. The censorship in libraries is an ongoing problem and it needs to be fixed.\"\n"," \"The diversity of the world makes it rather difficult to please every person all of the time. What I find appropreate, another @MONTH1 find obscene and volgur. What I enjoy to read, or listen to, or watch, or any other manner of media consumption I indulge in, @MONTH1 insult or bother someone else; as a matter of fact it probably does. That still does not make it right to remove what I, or others like because it offends another person.     A child walks through a grocery store, doesn't get what they want and proceeds to drop the f-bomb. More than half the time, they heard that language from their parents. If not their parents, then the media right? Maybe so, but that media shouldn't be hidden for the 'just-in-case' a child hears it. If a parent or guardian does not want their child to hear such things, they shouldn't allow them to listen to it. They control what does and does not enter their house.      To remove such things from the library, would be like trying to keep a child from ever seeing a naked body, or hearing a curse word. Every time they bathe they'd need blinders from themselves and they'd never be able to leave their house, because people do not always watch what they say in public.      No, I do not feel like every type of movie, or book, etc., belongs in the library. There is a cut-off as to how inapropreate or volgure something should be and still be allowed in a public library. Novels that are so descriptive that the reader can almost see every aspect of the procreation taking place between the pages, should have its own place, seperate from the public library, right along with the movies that really do show every aspect.     Although I like the thought, to actually remove said books would be unfair. To deny access to those who find those books fine for themselves wouyld be wrong. A wise author, Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' The truth of this statement would not be hard to prove.      A religious family that believes @PERSON2, a book I find to be innocent fantasy, is a book series promoting witchcraft and satanism, so they remove them from the library. I remove the previously stated graphic romance novels. A mother whom wants her child to be sheltered from what she considers the filth of the planet, removes books of drug addicts, and abuse, and books of war because they're full of death. And as this continues, finally, we are left with the empty shelfs of a forgotten building that no longer has a purpose.      The graphic novels I find inapropreate could be placed in an adult section, or higher up than most children can reach. The protective parents can deny their own children the media they deem inappropreate, instead of the world.     Although not everything is appropreate for everyone, it isn't right to censor something from the world. There are ways to cencor things to parts and not others. Nothing should be romoved from the library because of its content. At most it should be placed in a less accessable manner.\"\n"," 'There are many diffrent people in this world, who have many diffrent oppions about books, music, movies, magazines, etc., @CAPS1 because one person dose not perticualy like horor movies, that dose not mean that movies stores should remove horor films from there shelves. as creepy as it @MONTH1 sound. there are many people in the world who are slasher film freeks. the live and breath scarry movies. I myself like @CAPS1 about eveything out there. i will read any book of listen to any type of music, it actualy widens my taste in certain materials. i feel like everyone should try new things. Say growing up your favorite books were @CAPS2 The @CAPS3. and you would like to shaire your childhood stories with your children. BUT @CAPS4, books stores took @CAPS2 The @CAPS3 off of their shelves because a tiger and a pig could never be friends. This is nonsince. many people like many diffrent things.there is no reason to only sell what you like. otherwise your busines will fail.'\n"," \"What is consitered offensive? If we took books, music, movies and magazines that people found offensive of shelfs there would be nothing left. Everyone is diffrent which mean they all get offended in diffrent ways. By taking all this off shelfs we would be providing a smaller education for students around the world.          Things we learn about in school, slavery, wars and some pollitics. Now all these things could offend many people but if we were to take them of off the shelfs at school and libraries children will have no idea about history or what is going on in the current world. What about drugs and alchol, many parents do not talk to their childern about the uses of controlled substances, so without these sources they @MONTH1 never know the harm that they can do to someones body. Everyone takes something offensive but not everyone takes the same thing offensive. So who is to say what offends people and what does not? If thats the case shouldn't we take all books, movies, music and magazines away from childrens schools and libraries? Adults get offended to so would we take all of their resources away also including the newspaper. By taking away what one @MONTH1 call offensive @MONTH1 land us in the dark ages with no books, no local news, no movies, no nothing because not one person can say what the whole world considers offensive.   Everyone has the right to read and write what they want. No one can say what offends everyone. Someone @MONTH1 get offended by talking about ones race, another @MONTH1 get offended by talking about @CAPS1 and someone @MONTH1 even get offended if you talk about their cute little kitty cat. Everyone looks at everythings diffrently. So why try and control us all as one. All people think diffrent and they know what they want to read, hear and watch all by them selfs, they don't need someone to tell them.\"]\n","Writing Application Scores:  [4 4 3 4 2 3]\n","Language Convention Scores:  [4 4 4 4 2 4]\n","\n","Testing Set Essays and matching Scores:\n","Shape:  (1252,) (1252,)\n","Essays:  ['Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library Library'\n"," 'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.

all enjoy having the freedom to read, listen, and watch what we like. How would you feel if that freedom was taken away from you?  Some people believe that censored books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries. I believe you should have the right to read, listen, and watch whatever you choose, but children should talk to their parents about it first if it is a censored material.      We all know that not everything is okay for certain age groups to read, see, or listen to. That does not mean that the item should be removed completely though. Instead, the child should talk to a parent about the censored item. The parent can decide if the child is mature enough for the item. Also, if those materials are removed from libraries completely, someone that is mature enough to be reading, listening, or seeing it will not have a chance to.      I remember when I was in middle school, I really wanted to read @PERSON1 novels that I saw at the library. My mother believed that I should not read those novels at that age. My mother and I worked out a compromise that I could read @PERSON1 novels that she approved of. She said when I was older, I could read any of @PERSON1's novels that I wanted. I found this compromise to be very fair. I knew that when I was old enough to read those novels, they would still be there on the shelf waiting for me.     We should have the right to read, listen, and watch what we enjoy, but younger children or other age groups should be monitored. That does not mean we need to completely remove those materials from libraries though. When those children are old enough to read, watch, or listen to those materials, they should be able to go to the library, knowing it will be there on the shelf waiting for them.\n","[   0    0    0 ... 1655   22   33]\n","\n","Sample Essay for Testing:\n","Libraries @CAPS1 we would do without books? We wouldn't have libraries, right? And @CAPS1 if someone decided to remove certain books? Libraries are very helpful to us. They are our number one resource material. Libraries could teach us many things. We could learn many topics; history, biographies about important people from the past and our present, fiction and nonfiction stories and many more. Libraries are for all ages, from youngest to oldest. Libraries have many books, movies, magazines, sometimes even music and ect. Their is always something to learn in a library. I belive many topics are unappropriate to certain people of different ages. Yes, they are maybe to young to learn these topics, but @CAPS1 about when they get older and want to learn? We need libraries. We need books. Kids, teenagers and ect. will enentually learn the topic, either in the libraty or at home, even at school with friends; so why take our books away? I also belive that even though I don't like certain topics, they should not be removed from the libraries. I peronally agree with the author Katherine Paterson, she thought many books were offensive to the audiance, but if someone had the power to remove a book from the shelfs, that made everyone to have this power, and @CAPS1 would we have left? We would loose very important information of our lifes and our ancestors. People have different taste, fellings, thoughts. If we listen to every person's dislikes over our books in the libraries, our shelfs would be empty and eventually we wouldn't have libraries. I'm please asking you, don't remove our books of the shelfs. Don't take our past and our future. We are who we are because of the information books have thought us during the years. Books, magazines, movies and music are part of our lifes, taking them away, you are taking our lifes aswell the\n","[   0    0    0 ...  894 2423

magizines, and movies in are libaries? These meterials could consist of nude pictures and so on. Most parents do not want to see there kids getting a hold of this type of material. You maybe think 'what could  we do about this things, or least come to a compermise to make almost everyone happy. I have so reasons why we should put this type of material away from kids sight and reach.     First of all, the books and magizines that have any nude in them, should have their own section and, be labled aduts only. I know this might be alot of work but it is needed, so kids aren't aloud to go in ths section. This will help ruduce what little kids see. There are also books and magizines that are offensive to children of a different race. These books should be removed from the shelves also because they hert peoples feelings, and this might make customers leave your libary. I am not saying ouhae to take ever single book of your selves, but a least reduce the number of books of your selves out of kids eyes mostly and some adults if they are offended.          Next thing that comes to mind is the music on compacked discs, or cd's which ever you perfere.  In this day and age there are alot of musicians out there that have alot of bad words in their songs. These songs; are songs parents dont like there children to listen to, because parents are afraid of their children here these words and repeating them at home. These type of cd's should be taken of shelves where kids are, and put in a section also labled adults only. I know this wont stop kids from hearing these words and say them, but at least the parents can blame you for their child saying these words, because you did the smart thing and put these cd's out of kids reach. There are songs that are ofensive to people but i know you cant go throught every song and take them off the shelves, but a least take the cd's off the shelve that you know are offensive to people.     The last that comes to mind that should be taken off the shelves that are material children shouldnt see is the movies. There are movies out there that are to graphic, to vilent, and to much nudity that kids dont need to see. These type of movies need to also get a section that is for adults only. Then you have the movies that need to just be taking off the shelve because they are to offensive to some viewers. I know that you @MONTH1 say but if it is offensive to them, they dont have to get it. This maybe true but a least move the to a section that those people that get offended dont go.     Those were my thoughts on what should be done with material thats to offensive and not aprobriet for eyes or minds.These might be a little extreme but i hope you at least take some of these things into consideration. You cant please all but you can try. Thanks for reading this and i hope it as changed your thoughts on material thats bad for kids to see\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 4\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 3\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","x Incorrect - Grammar Eval\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 654:\n","Essay Text: I strongly believe that there are some materials that should not be allowed on the shevles. There are things in this world that kids should not see for a long time. If there are things that are offensive on the shelves, then kids can read it and it could lead to bad things.     When you enter a library, you don't want to see something that is very offensive. For example, one time my friend and I walked in to the library and the first thing we saw was a book about inappropiate things. We were young so that was the last thing we wanted to see. It was a horrible thing to see and I feel that no child should have to see that when they go into a library.     You can never unsee things. No parent wants their children going into a library and reading things they shouldn't. It @MONTH1 have an affect on their childrens behavior and future. If a child went into a library and began reading a book about drugs it could hurt their future. If the book was telling them that drugs aren't always bad, then that kid @MONTH1 grow up thinking it is okay to do drugs. This could really ruin someones life. I know that this @MONTH1 not always be true,but it could be in some cases.      If I was to walk into a library today, there probably wouldn't be to many things found offensive. I feel that as the years go on, there are less inappropriate things found on the shelves at libraries because people ask them to remove the book if it is offensive. If I was to find something bad there I would ask them to remove it from the shelf. I believe that everyone should have the right to remove a book from the shelf if it is offensive. I also think that eveyone would need a good reason to remove it because eventually there wouldn't be very many books left on the shelves.      I believe that these are all very good reasons to removes offensive books off the shelves at libraries. I hope that most would agree that no one should have to see these offensive books when they enter a library.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 4\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 3\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","x Incorrect - Writing Eval\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 655:\n","Essay Text: Do you think that certain books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves in a library if found offensive?Sometimes they should if found offensive by alot of people.Sometimes books are found offensive by a few people and the books should not be band.

It is history for everyone in the world to know. Sure it @MONTH1 bug some people that stuff like that is being written about them; however, they probably read material about you like that as well. How is that fair? Words in the library are just people's opinions about other people, groups, or other things.      Sure there are facts about what that group or person did, but that's history. People need to know what happened in the past so they can move on in the future. Books about slavery @MONTH1 be offensive to blacks, but now that people have read about it and what it caused, they realize how inhumane and bad it is. It's necesarry information to learn. People who get mad at libraries for carrying that material in their books just can't let go of the past or they care too much about what other people think.     As far as movies and music go, they are just informative videos about @LOCATION1's history, and music is for entertainment. You can't take all things you see hear in a literal way. They are not meant to be taken in an 'in your face' sort of way. It's not like there isn't another movie out there making fun of the one that offended you. Libraries carry this reading/learning material to help inform the less than average person or the more than average so they can both become smarter.       Libraries aren't made to make people angry about what some guy thought or said once. It is just a place to gain knowledge. If you don't want to let your child have access to information like that then I suggest that you don't let them go to the library ever. That's is what it was made for and will always be made for. Yeah the person who wrote that book or movie @MONTH1 not have gotten their information from a reliable source and said some false things about a group or person. It happens. But they are stilling trying to educate the reader. Education is what makes our world survive. We have to keep learning and the library makes that oppurtunity available with all the information it holds.      Libraries should keep every book that they have. If people take offense to it, read something else. There are far too many opinions in this world to take one person's and get mad about it. Libraries are centers of education. They hold the information to our past and possibly our future. If we are willing to learn about what happened and accept it. Once again, it's not meant to cause anger among groups or people. So do what you do best and keep writing stories you hear about in the news or anywhere. It's good information that is informative.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 4\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 3\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","x Incorrect - Grammar Eval\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 657:\n","Essay Text: Many books are helpful as you @MONTH1 know by now, but taking away books that are found, 'offensive' is repulsive.

These books that are found offensive to some @MONTH1 not be offensive to others, heres an example, lets say there is a recovering alcoholic and this person is flipping through a magazine and they see a alcoholic beverage ad in the magazine. This would be offensive to them but to the person next to him that collects fine wines its not offensive to him. This is all a matter of opinion, another example, there is a magazine that comes in that has a ammo add and one of the librarians finds it bad, but the others like to hunt game and they find it helpful to read an ad about ammounition for their next vacation to alaska.     As i said before it is all a sense of oppinions. Its one persons oppinion aganist others and its a never ending cycle, and its never going to stop. Basically this censorship is a game of he said , she said, and it is not fair to the people to take something away just because a few people do not like it.     Some people found racial profiling offensive others did not, some people seen what @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was doing was right, others didnt. Everyone has an opinion and everyone will express theirs no matter what its about, why they say it, and how you or anyone else feels, and that is how it will be until the end of time, and thats life. So holding books back just because a group of peoples opinion is outragous! This is a free country and we should be able to know that by not having people hide stuff just because a slight offense is brought into play.     This is my opinion on this matter and some @MONTH1 take offense to it, just hear me out when i say why let someone tell you what you can and cant read? Thats just wrong. Thank you for taking time to read what i had to say about this matter, and just understand the right to opinnions and how everyone has one and will express it.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 4\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 3\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","x Incorrect - Writing Eval\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 658:\n","Essay Text: Should good books be taken off the shelf because their not appropriate for @PERSON1 children? Should libraries be only child friendly? Censorship in public libraries isn't the answer to solve the problem with children in desiding on what books they want to explore. Public libraries have the title 'public' for a reason. Taking good books off shelves, that @MONTH1 not be good books for @PERSON1 children, instead should be catagorized in sections for @PERSON1 children, pre-teens, teenagers, and adults.     I beleive that censorship of libraries would be a very ignorant idea. Not to mention that it would create an uproar in the public tax payers. I don't beleive tax payers would appreciate that their tax money isn't going toward things that actually matter. A lot of the public @MONTH1 like those books and other media sources that's being taken away, @CAPS1 some @MONTH1 find the books offensive, but that dosen't mean that they have to get rid of the book, when they can just put the book down.     I do beleive that everyone should have a say in their public libraries to improve them, not disprove them. @PERSON1 children should be restricted from the sections that are not appropriate for their age and should be rederected to locations of sections that are appropriate for their age.     Censorship on this subject means sealing other ideas off and away from the public eyes. Some of those ideas can educate people very well with quality knowledge or not, but are brain candy and just are fun to read.      If people like Paterson are concerned about what @PERSON1 readers can read and uptain, they should be monitering what their children are reading and allow them or not, not the libraries. The libraries just carry the book.     Books that are offensive @MONTH1 show the reader new and interesting ideas. Some for example like 'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1' show what life was like in that time. And even if the book has offensive language for @PERSON1 children means that it should be correctly cattegorized\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 4\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 4\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 659:\n","Essay Text: A huge issue came to my attention today as I went to the library. I went to the computers to see if my favorite book available. The computer showed that the book was taken off the shelf for offending readers. I checked another list that listed numerous books, music, movies, and magazines that were also taken off of the shelves. Half of the list, I had checked out already. The librarian said the council is voting to take or not take specific books, music, movies, and other items off of the shelves for offensive content. As a regular library customer, I felt I needed to express my opinion of the topic. I believe that before these materials are taken off of the shelves that the librarians need to consider an age limit, a 'three strikes your out' rule, or how much these materials mean to people.     Offending people is not what these materials are meant to do. Some books can be perceived in that way which makes the readers angry. I can understand someone's feelings being hurt by a certain topic of reading, but that person @MONTH1 not be mature enough to comprehend what the book is intending as a message. My sister who is the age of ten has read a book which offended her, but she also didn't know what the book really was about. I believe that anyone the age of sixteen or older should be allowed access to these books, music, movies, and magazines. Age sixteeen is when most people are already in high school and more mature. Anyone younger than that shouldn't be allowed access to these items. If the readers are mature enough to handle the material, then people @MONTH1 not be offended as much.     Another new rule the library could try is the 'three strikes you're out rule.' @CAPS1 rule is when someone behaves inappropriately. Some people who behave inappropriately will tell everyone the book is offensive and make up stories about the book so their friends will laugh. Each person receives a strike every time they behave inappropriately. @CAPS1 includes in a school classroom as well as the library. After a certain amount of strikes, that person wouldn't be allowed to check out the material. The librarians could keep a record of @CAPS1 which could be accessed whenever. Even if the person is of age to check out the material, they couldn't do so if they had a certain amount of strikes on their record.     These materials mean a great deal to people. I am an avid reader as well as movie watcher. When I read a book, I feel like I have freedom. No one is telling me I perceive the book wrong, or that isn't what the character would look like. Reading a book is my own imagination making up the pictures of the story in my head. Taking these items off of the shelves takes away people's immagination. It also takes away from the writers freedom of speech in the @CAPS2 of @CAPS3. The writers wrote their book under that @CAPS2 and now there freedom is basically being taken away from them by taking there speech off of shelves.     Overall, I believe that these materials shouldn't be taken off of the shelves. The librarians should consider either making up new rules or thinking about people's opinions of the subject. The librarians should also consider the freedom of speech rule when they are taking these materials off of the shelves. If they don't consider any of these options, then all offensive materials would be taken away. One person could say a book or movie is offensive and it would be taken off of the shelf. After awhile, the library would eventually become empty. What would be left to check out?\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 3\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 4\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","x Incorrect - Writing Eval\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 660:\n","Essay Text: Have you ever went to the library and picked up a book that you thought was good?     Well some people pick books by the way the cover looks,some pick it by what it says on the back,But some people pick it by what kind of book it is.If every librarian took the books off the shelf that were offensive, there would be barely any left.Just because the book is offensive doesn't mean that it's a bad book,and that doesn't mean that your not goin to learn something out of it because it's offensive.     I do not believe that certain books should be taken off the shelf just for the kind of material that it is.If other people don't like the material in the book then they don't have to read it.Some people learn things from lessons that are learned the hard way.So maybe if they didn't like the book because of the way it was written,they should read it anyways.Offensive books can teach people lessons about how other things in the world are.     Not everything that people read is going to be nice.Just like everything in the world isn't nice but we deal with it anyways.There's always going to be a really offensive person in the word,but you can't just take them off the shelve becuase that person is mean or you don't like what he's saying.If we killed every offensive person in the world, there would be barely any people left.     So i don't agree with taking every book off the shelf that's offensive.There is always going to be something offensive out there in the world,and we can't just get rid of everything that we think needs to go because it's offensive.That would make no sense.Not every thing's nice and sugarcoated,you have to see other parts of the world too,and i think that taking offensive books off the shelf is not the right way to go.\n","\n","Actual Score    -

These meterials could consist of nude pictures and so on. Most parents do not want to see there kids getting a hold of this type of material. You maybe think 'what could we do about this things, or least come to a compermise to make almost everyone happy. I have so reasons why we should put this type of material away from kids sight and reach. First of all, the books and magizines that have any nude in them, should have their own section and, be labled aduts only. I know this might be alot of work but it is needed, so kids aren't aloud to go in ths section. This will help ruduce what little kids see. There are also books and magizines that are offensive to children of a different race. These books should be removed from the shelves also because they hert peoples feelings, and this might make customers leave your libary. I am not saying ouhae to take ever single book of your selves, but a least reduce the number of books of your selves out of kids eyes mostly and some adults if they are offended. Next thing that comes to mind is the music on compacked discs, or cd's which ever you perfere. In this day and age there are alot of musicians out there that have alot of bad words in their songs. These songs; are songs parents dont like there children to listen to, because parents are afraid of their children here these words and repeating them at home. These type of cd's should be taken of shelves where kids are, and put in a section also labled adults only. I know this wont stop kids from hearing these words and say them, but at least the parents can blame you for their child saying these words, because you did the smart thing and put these cd's out of kids reach. There are songs that are ofensive to people but i know you cant go throught every song and take them off the shelves, but a least take the cd's off the shelve that you know are offensive to people. The last that comes to mind that should be taken off the shelves that are material children shouldnt see is the movies. There are movies out there that are to graphic, to vilent, and to much nudity that kids dont need to see. These type of movies need to also get a section that is for adults only. Then you have the movies that need to just be taking off the shelve because they are to offensive to some viewers. I know that you @MONTH1 say but if it is offensive to them, they dont have to get it. This maybe true but a least move the to a section that those people that get offended dont go. Those were my thoughts on what should be done with material thats to offensive and not aprobriet for eyes or minds.These might be a little extreme but i hope you at least take some of these things into consideration. You cant please all but you can try. Thanks for reading this and i hope it as changed your thoughts on material thats bad for kids to see library\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 54:\n","Essay Text: I strongly believe that there are some materials that should not be allowed on the shevles. There are things in this world that kids should not see for a long time. If there are things that are offensive on the shelves, then kids can read it and it could lead to bad things. When you enter a library, you don't want to see something that is very offensive. For example, one time my friend and I walked in to the library and the first thing we saw was a book about inappropiate things. We were young so that was the last thing we wanted to see. It was a horrible thing to see and I feel that no child should have to see that when they go into a library. You can never unsee things. No parent wants their children going into a library and reading things they shouldn't. It @MONTH1 have an affect on their childrens behavior and future. If a child went into a library and began reading a book about drugs it could hurt their future. If the book was telling them that drugs aren't always bad, then that kid @MONTH1 grow up thinking it is okay to do drugs. This could really ruin someones life. I know that this @MONTH1 not always be true,but it could be in some cases. If I was to walk into a library today, there probably wouldn't be to many things found offensive. I feel that as the years go on, there are less inappropriate things found on the shelves at libraries because people ask them to remove the book if it is offensive. If I was to find something bad there I would ask them to remove it from the shelf. I believe that everyone should have the right to remove a book from the shelf if it is offensive. I also think that eveyone would need a good reason to remove it because eventually there wouldn't be very many books left on the shelves. I believe that these are all very good reasons to removes offensive books off the shelves at libraries. I hope that most would agree that no one should have to see these offensive books when they enter a library. library\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 55:\n","Essay Text: Do you think that certain books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves in a library if found offensive?Sometimes they should if found offensive by alot of people.Sometimes books are found offensive by a few people and the books should not be band.

It is history for everyone in the world to know. Sure it @MONTH1 bug some people that stuff like that is being written about them; however, they probably read material about you like that as well. How is that fair? Words in the library are just people's opinions about other people, groups, or other things. Sure there are facts about what that group or person did, but that's history. People need to know what happened in the past so they can move on in the future. Books about slavery @MONTH1 be offensive to blacks, but now that people have read about it and what it caused, they realize how inhumane and bad it is. It's necesarry information to learn. People who get mad at libraries for carrying that material in their books just can't let go of the past or they care too much about what other people think. As far as movies and music go, they are just informative videos about @LOCATION1's history, and music is for entertainment. You can't take all things you see hear in a literal way. They are not meant to be taken in an 'in your face' sort of way. It's not like there isn't another movie out there making fun of the one that offended you. Libraries carry this reading/learning material to help inform the less than average person or the more than average so they can both become smarter. Libraries aren't made to make people angry about what some guy thought or said once. It is just a place to gain knowledge. If you don't want to let your child have access to information like that then I suggest that you don't let them go to the library ever. That's is what it was made for and will always be made for. Yeah the person who wrote that book or movie @MONTH1 not have gotten their information from a reliable source and said some false things about a group or person. It happens. But they are stilling trying to educate the reader. Education is what makes our world survive. We have to keep learning and the library makes that oppurtunity available with all the information it holds. Libraries should keep every book that they have. If people take offense to it, read something else. There are far too many opinions in this world to take one person's and get mad about it. Libraries are centers of education. They hold the information to our past and possibly our future. If we are willing to learn about what happened and accept it. Once again, it's not meant to cause anger among groups or people.

I believe that these books, movies, music, magazines, should be kept on the shelves. There are many reasons for keeping these books for the public, one main one is that who ever has a membership to the library paid to see everything. These books that are found offensive to some @MONTH1 not be offensive to others, heres an example, lets say there is a recovering alcoholic and this person is flipping through a magazine and they see a alcoholic beverage ad in the magazine. This would be offensive to them but to the person next to him that collects fine wines its not offensive to him. This is all a matter of opinion, another example, there is a magazine that comes in that has a ammo add and one of the librarians finds it bad, but the others like to hunt game and they find it helpful to read an ad about ammounition for their next vacation to alaska. As i said before it is all a sense of oppinions. Its one persons oppinion aganist others and its a never ending cycle, and its never going to stop. Basically this censorship is a game of he said , she said, and it is not fair to the people to take something away just because a few people do not like it. Some people found racial profiling offensive others did not, some people seen what @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was doing was right, others didnt. Everyone has an opinion and everyone will express theirs no matter what its about, why they say it, and how you or anyone else feels, and that is how it will be until the end of time, and thats life. So holding books back just because a group of peoples opinion is outragous! This is a free country and we should be able to know that by not having people hide stuff just because a slight offense is brought into play. This is my opinion on this matter and some @MONTH1 take offense to it, just hear me out when i say why let someone tell you what you can and cant read? Thats just wrong. Thank you for taking time to read what i had to say about this matter, and just understand the right to opinnions and how everyone has one and will express it. library\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 58:\n","Essay Text: Should good books be taken off the shelf because their not appropriate for @PERSON1 children? Should libraries be only child friendly? Censorship in public libraries isn't the answer to solve the problem with children in desiding on what books they want to explore. Public libraries have the title 'public' for a reason. Taking good books off shelves, that @MONTH1 not be good books for @PERSON1 children, instead should be catagorized in sections for @PERSON1 children, pre-teens, teenagers, and adults. I beleive that censorship of libraries would be a very ignorant idea. Not to mention that it would create an uproar in the public tax payers. I don't beleive tax payers would appreciate that their tax money isn't going toward things that actually matter. A lot of the public @MONTH1 like those books and other media sources that's being taken away, @CAPS1 some @MONTH1 find the books offensive, but that dosen't mean that they have to get rid of the book, when they can just put the book down. I do beleive that everyone should have a say in their public libraries to improve them, not disprove them. @PERSON1 children should be restricted from the sections that are not appropriate for their age and should be rederected to locations of sections that are appropriate for their age. Censorship on this subject means sealing other ideas off and away from the public eyes. Some of those ideas can educate people very well with quality knowledge or not, but are brain candy and just are fun to read. If people like Paterson are concerned about what @PERSON1 readers can read and uptain, they should be monitering what their children are reading and allow them or not, not the libraries. The libraries just carry the book. Books that are offensive @MONTH1 show the reader new and interesting ideas. Some for example like 'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1' show what life was like in that time. And even if the book has offensive language for @PERSON1 children means that it should be correctly cattegorized library\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 59:\n","Essay Text: A huge issue came to my attention today as I went to the library. I went to the computers to see if my favorite book available. The computer showed that the book was taken off the shelf for offending readers. I checked another list that listed numerous books, music, movies, and magazines that were also taken off of the shelves. Half of the list, I had checked out already. The librarian said the council is voting to take or not take specific books, music, movies, and other items off of the shelves for offensive content. As a regular library customer, I felt I needed to express my opinion of the topic. I believe that before these materials are taken off of the shelves that the librarians need to consider an age limit, a 'three strikes your out' rule, or how much these materials mean to people. Offending people is not what these materials are meant to do. Some books can be perceived in that way which makes the readers angry. I can understand someone's feelings being hurt by a certain topic of reading, but that person @MONTH1 not be mature enough to comprehend what the book is intending as a message. My sister who is the age of ten has read a book which offended her, but she also didn't know what the book really was about. I believe that anyone the age of sixteen or older should be allowed access to these books, music, movies, and magazines. Age sixteeen is when most people are already in high school and more mature. Anyone younger than that shouldn't be allowed access to these items. If the readers are mature enough to handle the material, then people @MONTH1 not be offended as much. Another new rule the library could try is the 'three strikes you're out rule.' @CAPS1 rule is when someone behaves inappropriately. Some people who behave inappropriately will tell everyone the book is offensive and make up stories about the book so their friends will laugh. Each person receives a strike every time they behave inappropriately. @CAPS1 includes in a school classroom as well as the library. After a certain amount of strikes, that person wouldn't be allowed to check out the material. The librarians could keep a record of @CAPS1 which could be accessed whenever. Even if the person is of age to check out the material, they couldn't do so if they had a certain amount of strikes on their record. These materials mean a great deal to people. I am an avid reader as well as movie watcher. When I read a book, I feel like I have freedom. No one is telling me I perceive the book wrong, or that isn't what the character would look like. Reading a book is my own imagination making up the pictures of the story in my head. Taking these items off of the shelves takes away people's immagination. It also takes away from the writers freedom of speech in the @CAPS2 of @CAPS3. The writers wrote their book under that @CAPS2 and now there freedom is basically being taken away from them by taking there speech off of shelves. Overall, I believe that these materials shouldn't be taken off of the shelves. The librarians should consider either making up new rules or thinking about people's opinions of the subject. The librarians should also consider the freedom of speech rule when they are taking these materials off of the shelves.

I do not believe that certain books should be taken off the shelf just for the kind of material that it is.If other people don't like the material in the book then they don't have to read it.Some people learn things from lessons that are learned the hard way.So maybe if they didn't like the book because of the way it was written,they should read it anyways.Offensive books can teach people lessons about how other things in the world are. Not everything that people read is going to be nice.Just like everything in the world isn't nice but we deal with it anyways.There's always going to be a really offensive person in the word,but you can't just take them off the shelve becuase that person is mean or you don't like what he's saying.If we killed every offensive person in the world, there would be barely any people left.

So my answer is no, no books, music, movies, magazines should be banned from the library because one person, or mabye the majority of people find it offensive. There is no reason to tarnish anyone elses reading, listening, or watching anything of their interest because others find it offensive. The solution that could solve all this, is for the people that find them offensive, can just completely ignore that material.I can understand by my own experiences how people can find such materials a problem though. For an example, I've read books, listened to music, watched movies, even read magazines that were offensive too me. The biggest problem that occurs in those materials to make them offensive, is usually racism. Most people can deal with it though, so if they can you should be able to, right? As I have stated before, just because you don't like it does not mean that you should disapprove of it. If you disapprove of it and get the material removed from the library then the others who liked it, won't be able to read, listen, nor watch it.The statement I'm making here, is me pretty much saying that onless you only care about yourself, then sure report about it.If you are not a person that only cares of yourself, then you would let the book stay even though you don't like it, because others @MONTH1 like it. My observations of this sort of thing is I've seen people complain how they've read this book, and it was racist towards their well-being. From my own personal readings I've understood that many people have a lot of pride for themselves of who they are and what they are. People need to understand though, it was written by someone else.You @MONTH1 judge, but out of your own respect, should not report to remove of something for their ideas. library\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 62:\n","Essay Text: Here is what I think about materials being removed from the shelves if they are offensive. I think that some people have different things they like to read and listen to. Someone might like a certain type of book, and another might think it's offensive. So what do you do about this situation? Yes, there might be some books that could be offensive to people if they are about certain things. What if a little kid is in the adult area looking at books and they find a book they shouldn't have seen? Well most parents would want those books to be removed from the library. There could also be books that are just offensive to adults because of what they are about. I've seen people at my library get offended by something they read and they didn't want it back on the shelf. What if there are some @CAPS1's that a little kid checks out and it has language in the music? I don't think that any of that music should be in the library at all. Especially with little kids roaming the library. The music in the library could be offensive to other people to. Not just young kids. When you walk into a library usually the first thing you see are magazines. There can be some pretty inapropriate magazines with inapropriate covers. Is this really what you want people looking at? Especially young kids? There are also movies at a library. Yes, most of them are old movies, but some of them are also kids movies. What if one of those old movies had a bad cover on it, or bad language? A lot of movies are also offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3. I think this because, back in the old days there was a lot of racism, and that is still in alot of movies now. There could also be movies against someones religion. That could be very offensive to certain people. Most of this stuff in libraries can be offensive to young kids because of the covers. Some can be offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because of racism. I think that if you have a problem with something that you see on a shelf, you should tell the librarian and see if they will take it off the shelf. You shouldn't have to be offended by something at the library. I think that people should have their rights to get certain materials off of the shelf. Especially if they think it's offensive to them, or anybody else that might happen to see the same thing. Is this really what we want in our libraries is offensive materials?

And why somethings do not need to be sensored at the library. I will help you to understand what young teenagers or younger children should and should not be able to see or borrow from the library. There are somethings that should be kept from the kids eyes. What are some of the movies, books, or magazines that should be hidden from children? This is probably what you are woundering. The first thing that kids should not be allowed to borrow would be movies that have any that is over there age requirement to see at the movie theather. The reason this is so that the teenager or young child does not watch anything that @MONTH1 scary them. Another thing that should not be seen would be the movies that are meant for a mature veiwer meaning an adult viewer. There are a few books that kids should not be able to read until they are an adult. And these books would be the ones that have a harsh backround on past events that happened. Like what happen during a war to a captured soldier or a prisoner of war. And what they to go through during their imprisonment. These are the books that should be hidden from younger childern. There are some movies, books, music, magazines that do not need to be sensored for people to see. Starting with why some movie do not need to be sensored. First is because most movies are funny but have just a little need of maturity. These movies are the ones that have alot of comedy and as most adults know most kids are into the funny movies. So why take away a movie that is something a kid would have a great time watching. There are some books that should probably be read by adults but there are some teenagers that are mature enough to read this stories. Or if they need to learn about a specific topic for school work they should be allowed to read that book. I do not think that any genre or group of music should be sensored. This because music is a way for someone to express themselves without even having to truely say anything. about who they are or what kind of a mood they are in. music does much more then just that though it helps some people vent on there anger or even how sad they @MONTH1 be. But in conclusion I think there are many things that are good but still need to be sensored for most of the young childern and teenagers to be able to see.

I believe they should allow these certain category of books, movies, and magazines to be allowed, however to an extent. Libraries should open up an area for people above the age of @NUM1 to view this material with a special membership. Books and magazines in libraries are, and should be seperated by categories. The books and magazines that could be considered 'highly offensive,' do not belong on the library shelves at all. However, books and magazines that give out informative data with proper conduct should be allowed. If libraries create an area in which peoples' prefrences are to view content over the age of @NUM1, they should be required to have their own membership. In order to even look at material that is uncensored, visitors need a special pass; this way people who get offended by material that is not censored do not have to pass it while inside the library. Many people who do not want to go out and spend @MONEY1 on a movie rental like to go to the library. Libraries should allow movies from the ranges of ratings @CAPS1(@CAPS2) to @CAPS3(@CAPS4) to be on the shelves of the library. Going into a public library should not have any more restrictions that going into a public video store. However, videos that are considered 'pornography,' should not be in any part of the library. Just like in a public video store, libraries should not contain any footage that is considered pornography. Much of the popular music today is considered offensive. The music in libraries can still be the same songs, but they need to have clean content in them. I believe that edited music in libraries is okay under any circumstances. I do not believe that explicit music is okay. People inside the library could be listening to this explicit music before they take it home, while others in the library get offended by it. People overhearing music would not happen often, but we need to make sure it does not happen at all. Overall, material in libraries that could be considered offensive should not be allowed to be viewed except under special memberships that have proof that an individual is over the age of @NUM1. We all need to work together to make sure our libraries stay clean and unoffensive.

As little kids we all were tought to pick up a book and read but as we get older we fall off, but what people do not know is, books help develop your reading and vocabulary skills.

Libraries are suppose to have books that everyone can read and learn from, so if they don't have books for everyone the library should'nt be there. I disagree with removing certain material from the library and here is why. First, the reason why i would'nt remove certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc., because the library is a place where people come to learn about new things. Just because one person does'nt like the book does'nt make it right for them to remove it. If people don't wont their children to read the book don't let them go to the library. They go buy their child some good books to read. Also, no one would want to go to a library that does'nt have what they are looking for. That would'nt be a good look for the library, because if someone goes there and find that all the books their looking for is not in and this is the only library in town they would never want to go back there again. Then they would tell moe people about how that library does'nt have anything your looking for in it. Then, the library would get old close down then get knocked down, and in the shot were the library use to be would be a mini mall, food store, ect. so i really don't think it's a good idea to take book off the shelves at the libraries. We need those books because you never know when something can come up and you need that one book that is not there. In conclusion, removing books from the shelves is a bad thing to do.

Kid's reading offensive things and seeing offensive things will hurt them due to them still learning basic things in life. Once when I was little, I picked up and read a book about drugs and sex. They talked about how they feel, where you can get them from, and what they looked like. For a minor reading on how to get drugs and use them, that's telling them to much. It is not a good thing to tell kid's so early in their life about drugs because, they are going to get curious about how the drugs feel. When I was told about drugs I was very curious and I wanted to learn more about them. The older and boring we become the more we will want to try the drugs we learned about earlier in our lives. More people every day try drugs because there is nothing else to do. When I learned about sex while being a kid made me want to try it because they made it sound good in books. Being teached offensive things in libraries is a bad thing because, who would think something bad could be in a library?

Libraries should have sections that are age appropriate. That way if a book is too bad in some way then the mature audience would read it and an audience that should be reading children's books would not be in that section.

And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' -@ORGANIZATION1 quote moves mountians with its wisdom. In @ORGANIZATION1 day and age, many of the things we read/see in magazines, movies, the news etc. are considered to be quite offensive to many. Would a mother of a fifteen year old be upset if @CAPS5 found her daughter reading a magazine that stated, 'safe sex is great sex', or a father finding his teenage son watching a movie with pornographic scenes? The answer is no. The magazines, movies, music and books that are being sent out into libraries all over the world are not exactly '@CAPS1 rated' and many adults would be shocked to realize exactly what it is teenagers are viewing; but is it right to then remove everything some one finds to be wrong or offensive? Lets think about religion for a second. Atheists would find the bible to be a lie, maybe even find it offensive. So in turn to be considerate of their beliefs does that make it 'right' to remove the bible from libraries and open access to the public? Think about the novel, 'To @CAPS2 a @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. English scholars around the world will state that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a novel of its time; that it will continue to be read hundreds of years from now at schools around the world. Some though, would find @ORGANIZATION1 book offensive. The word 'nigger' is placed in @ORGANIZATION1 novel many times and is set in a time when slavery is not frowned apon. Just because one parent finds @ORGANIZATION1 book to be offensive does that mean students from all over should no longer be allowed to read it; that @ORGANIZATION1 book should be 'removed from the shelves?' The questions posed here are not simple questions, they require much time and thought. If a survey was posted asking: Should certain materials be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? The outcome would be intangible to think about now, considering people have many different views on the aspect. In reading @ORGANIZATION1 and contemplating the questions asked you will realize that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a black or white concept; there lies a large area of grey in the middle. Something that one @MONTH1 find offensive, another would not; something a teenager views as interesting an adult @MONTH1 view as crude or vulger. Does @ORGANIZATION1 mean that everything would be taken down from the shelves then? Yes. In the quote above by Katherine Paterson, @CAPS5 states, '.. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS5 is correct in @ORGANIZATION1 because @CAPS5 realizes that everyone has different views on what is appropriate or not. @ORGANIZATION1 statement shows that although libraries @MONTH1 allow inappropriate novels, magazines, tapes etc. to be open to the easy access of customers there is no way that they would be able to make everyone feel content without completely wiping out the building of its contents. The right to take a book away also is a right to leave it; leave the books then and let the ones who enjoy them, simply enjoy. library\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 76:\n","Essay Text: We have all read a book or heard a song that has offended us or just didn't catch our intrest, right?

Therefore if you could just remove something off the shelf or censor it so somebody is prohibited to explore it, it wouldn't be fair because there is somebody in this world that adores or would adore that. Your taking away privelages of everyone else, keeping them from wonderful stories and lyrics. Would you want someone to take away your favorite book or song? No, and neither would anyone else in this world. I agree with Katherine Paterson, everthing would be gone in the end if we had the power to take something away that we didn't like. Nobody would have anything to read, listen to, or watch because we all can't agree on anything in this world. library\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 77:\n","Essay Text: Well i think that if you dont wont to read a book like saterday night lights then its ok.

I'll begin by asking; what is censorship? Think about that question while you're reading, or stop and think a moment before you continue. I hope what I have to say will give you a clear idea or a new perspective, and that you might understand what I think the importance of censorship in libraries really means, and not just to me, but to all who pick up a book. To answer my previous question, censoring is the removing of suggestive or otherwise offensive materials from any or all sources of information, or entertainment. Now I'll ask another question; why do we have censorship? Most believe that all children have a right to know things they'll learn about eventually whether or not they want to, and therefore don't care when their children are exposed to that knowledge. Those people don't consider the consequences of that knowledge in the wrong hands, or wrong minds. Children don't think on the same track that most adults do, and therefore are incapable of handling certain knowledges that adults have long since known and otherwise dealt with. Those who know of the consequences of certain knowledges in the wrong minds have tried to keep the information from those who can't or shouldn't worry about them untill they're older and more capable of understanding what it all means. A lot of ideas we have @DATE1, from science and technology, from philosophical thinking to common sense, most everything has been written down in the past, or is being written @DATE1. That's where the problems arise. Almost everything is written about or recorded in some way, therefore increasing the chances that someone will hear or see this knowledge and, not knowing it's importance, might even abuse it eventually. Think about the crimes that go on @DATE1. Are all of them simple? Do they all focus on the same things? How do they come about? All these questions are able to be answered in the simplest ways; the people who commited them learned about something too early in life and grew up thinking it was ok, whether they learned it from books, or music, or movies, etc., and eventually repeated these things they learned. Of course that's not always the case, but for those people who don't know why so many people ended up as the people who get thrown into jail, or get into trouble, a major factor is what they learn at an early age, and not having sensible people to help them to know what's right and what's wrong. To conclude, I think the best ways to avoid the wrong information getting into the wrong hands, is to have censorship in libraries. Without it, people can just walk up to any shelf and pick up that one book, even a nine-year-old child. library\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 80:\n","Essay Text: Some books, music, movies, and magazines or other types of information or entertanment are innapropriate. I dont believe that they should be removed from the library or other puplic places for that reason though. You have to take a lot into conciteration before decideing weather it should be censored or not. Age is one aspect. If the material is not sutable to a sertain age then it should be organized into a different age category according to the library. I believe that there should be age limits like the ones they have on movies or video games. Rescently there was a book, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, that was questioned on the use of language in it. I think that the author wrote their book the way they want it and would like it sold that way not have it censored. If you find something offensive that doesen't mean you should keep getting involved with it. If there is a book or movie that is offfensive to you, you can stop reading or stop watching it at your own will. Often on the radio there are songs that use innapropriate language and it is bleeped out. Why should we bleep it? Some people could find it more offensive to hear it bleeped than to hear the words just said. And thier oppinion should be the one that counts. The questin weather there should be censorship in libraries is all about a persons perspecitve. Someone is always going to see it differently than you. There is nothing bad about that. I remember watching a show one time and there were these characters in a book club and they were debateing the book its self. Not always is everyone going to like your oppinion of something but you shouldn't despise people for that. I believe that the libraries should not have to use censorship when we have lived as humans long enough to be able to make a decision for ourselves.

I never even heard of a problem in the libraries about things offending people before but sometimes people just need to grow up. There's a certain point to where yeah things should not be writen or films that should'nt have been made but if you dont like it, then dont read it and or watch it. People all have a right to the libraries. Nobody forces anyone to read or watch something, its by the readers choice. Theres no sence in ruining many peoples enjoyment just because a selected few people dont like something. Thats like the @ORGANIZATION2 not having any football just because the players feel like they dont get payed enough @MONEY1 to play it. Taking books and magazines off the library shelves is like the @ORGANIZATION2 locking out everything. Just because a few people arent happy, doesnt mean that everything should be taking out so others cant enjoy it. Why even have a library if your going to change everything because people get offended. Is @ORGANIZATION1 going to stop carrying penuts because some people are allergic to them? No. If people dont like something they have the choice to buy or take it if they want to or not. Its a simple fact that some things should just be left alone. People are all different. Its going to take a long time for people to figure that out. In fact, people @MONTH1 never figure that out.

Imagine a little girl about the age of four walking through differnce sections of books in a library when she finds a book that cacthes her eye in the adult section. The book is baby blue and has a little bird on it. However, the book also has a half naked man on cover besided the cute little bird. The girl grabs the book and goes happly to find her mom. When the mom looks at the book her face is in shock. What would you do if that was your daughter? Most likely we'd put the book back and explain why she can't have it. While, others would go screaming to the check out and asking, 'how is it possible that my daughter got this? Shouldn't the libraries be wacthing the kids to make sure they don't go in that section?'. I believe that certain materials, such as books,movies, ect., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact people will still find way to get the removed material and that it's just a part of life. My first reason that certain materials, such as books, shouldn't be pulled from are shelves is that we live in a nation that prides it's self as the '@CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. That doesn't mean we get everything for @CAPS2 when we go to a store it just simple means that you, the people of @LOCATION1, have the freedom and right to speak your mind. So you can say whatever you want in newspapers or in books because the government gives you that right. However, you can't say 'I have a bomb' at the airports because of the many attacks the nation has encountered over the years, but that's common sences. My second reason that certain materials should say on the put, even if someone is offened by it is that no matter how many books or movies you take of the store shelves, the people will find a way to get them. One way to get them is the black market where people sell drugs and weapons. Do we, as a country really need another drug on the market even if it's a book? I think not. Also, if you look at the whole picture people will be losing jobs because the televison today is not the kind they had back in your grandma's day. Nearly @PERCENT1 of everything on televison has something to do with the little three letter s-word every parent hates to talk about. You might be thinking that if we take the unrated movies and the books with the naked men on the cover we'd be saving are children which leads me to my last point. Seeing unrated movies and such is a part of life. So what are you saving them from? Children sooner or later will grow up and learn about the types of subject matter so why take it off when you will have to teach them about it sooner rather then later? Millions of parents around the @CAPS3 each and every year have to teach their kids about the birds and the bees. It's a part of growing up in a way. Now a days though, the birds and the bees are all people seem to talk about. So like it or not your kids will find out just like you did and your parents before you. Plus, your not going to make everyone happy. Someone will always be offened by something. Imagine. Imagine that same little girl, now an adult, having to deal with that same issue of the same baby blue book with the same little bird with the half naked man on the cover. The truth is that this way my mother when she was little and it turns out that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree because I had the same issue as well. I know that one day I will also have the same issue as my mother did before me. So I believe that certain materials, such as books and movies, shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact that people will still find a way to get the removed material and that it's just apart of life.

The media should be for everyone to enjoy and not have to worry about offensive material. In @DATE1's world there are offensive media out there and they often start up problems. We need to do something about this problem. If there are offensive media out there the kids of the future are going to look up to them and try to be like them or hate the same thing that the media does. Let's just say there was a song about school and how people dont like it don't you think our kids are going to hate school too? I don't think that is right. We need to teach our kids that school is very important and not to take in what the media says because they are not always right. We want enjoyable media in the world. We want good things for our future kids to see and hear. We don't want kids picking up bad words. We need to watch what we put out in the world. If there is something offensive remove it from the shelves as soon as possible or just not put it out to the public at all. Offensive media can often start up problems in the world. Weither it's in the @CAPS2.S or somewhere around the world. If a book talks about how bad a certain race is those people that were disliked in the book are going to get even with the people who made the book or other media. Many issues @DATE1 are over media out there in the world. People that work at libraries should keep an eye out for offensive materals and shoud remove them to prevent even more problems. I'm sure libraries all around the world have some kind of offensive media in it. We need to stand up and fight to get rid of all offensive media and make the world a better place.

Truth be told, there are many ways for our offspring to not have the availability of those books. There is what I believe to be an appropriate division on the materials in our libraries and bookstores, the fact that we can always monitor what our children read and watch, and not to mention that we can use the internet to back up any doubts we have on the literature and lyrics.The question that remains is: Are we using the ways of preventing this problem to the best of our abilities? I believe that our public libraries and bookstores do a splendid job of diviying up what is deemed appropriate for each age group. Teens know a fairly good amount more about things than all parents invision they shouldn't, and I think the bookstores and libraries keep the youths knowledge in what they're listening, watching, and reading to what these kids already know. Comparing what is considered a 'young adult' book and an 'adult' book, you will find an atrocious difference. Young adult books only hint around things such as drugs, refraining from abstinence, and grisly murder scenes whereas adult books go into a great deal more detail. Middle school level children's books are even more less detailed than teen books, so it is save to say that as long as the parents are directing their child into the appropriate section in anyone's given local library, they will be in good hands. There's also the option of monitering what our young ones are listening to. By simply being interested in what it is that the child is singing or humming along to, us parents would find that they wouldn't be reluctant to let on about what was being said. If in any case we feel that the lyrics are too harsh for the kid, we are still their parents and have the right to deem it as something they shouldn't be listening to and suggest something different to them and/or ban them from being able to listen. In @CAPS1 cases though, we should try to listen to what our kids are. In this way, we can be reassured that the range of materials they're plugging into their ears are not what we would consider to be grotesque for something our children's age. Another useful tool would have to be the internet. If we don't feel the need to ask about the literature or music, but @MONTH1 still have a few doubts, there are plenty of book and music blogs across the world wide web that can help us out. Even by going to a bookstore website and reading the description about the book, or a lyric website that will tell us what is being said, or even a movie website where we can see a rating and the content of the movie, and the comments left by people that go with it respectively, @CAPS1 of us would find all of the information we need. Even author's, director's, and artist's websites would be useful. Looking at their discussions would be a big help as well, considering that @CAPS1 of these people have a vision of what age groups would be attracted to their material. In conclusion, I think our children are fairly wise about what they choose to read, listen to, and watch, but then again, it all depends on the preference. Not every child is the same, just as not any adult, or any one person. The prefernce tends to lean towards the things we think are appropriate. Paying attention to what the young ones are like says alot about what they read, and what they listen to and watch, for that matter.

Many people ask how is it ok for that material to be open to teenagers and possibly children. In my opinion I think that it is not right for libraries not to do anything about this problem, especially when this is happening across the nation. In large department stores such as @ORGANIZATION1, you are required to be eighteen years old to purchase adult items, sometimes you must be twenty-one years of age. It is considered illegal for anyone under the required age to purchase an item with an age limit on it. Music is a totally different type of profanity, @CAPS1 albums are sold with much innapropiate material in them that is open to the public, but the @CAPS1's sold in stores are usually edited into a more appropiate version. Days like today nearly no one ever buys @CAPS1's anymore, its all about @CAPS4's and @NUM1's where all you have to do is find your song on a site and download it for free in about four to five seconds. It would not surprise me if libraries had music and @CAPS1's with just as much adult profanity, and language that is not edited out. So if most of the things in this world that are adult rated and can not be purchased unless your considered an adult by age, why should it be ok to viewed by any age in a library. I myself believe that it should be illegal for materials such as the ones mentioned to be banned or atleast taken more respected with the viewer of the materials. It would really hurt a parent for them to take a kid to a library and tell them to go find a book they like, and they return to their mother or father with an adult book with many things a child or possibly a teenager should not see. I believe times like those could tear a parent or even a grandparent apart, having to explain to their children or grandchildren what they just saw. Because most of us know that most children always want to know what something is when they see it, and for a parent to have to explain to their child at that age has to be heart-stopping. In all of this that I have explained is only my opinion, but I believe many other millions of people agree with me. If it is not aloud almost everywhere else in this world, why should it be ok a library to do it? Is it because its some little rule about freedom of decision? Do libraries think just because they are old fashioned and have been here longer than the @CAPS1's, @CAPS4's, and @NUM1's that they dont have to follow rules and guidelines. It is a shame that they are ruining the lives and visions of the children and teens today to think its ok for anyone to see, listen, or watch these materials. library\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 87:\n","Essay Text: There are many books in the libraries.

I say no that the books, music, movies, or magazines should not be removed from libraries, because if the books or etc. are that offensive, those things shouldn't be in childrens reach anyway. There should be a section limit where children can't go by to get to the offensive type books and others. Why take things that older people would insist on looking at off the shelf just because someone didn't separate the adult books and etc., from the childrens. Taking away the things that adults look at would be just as bad as taking the things that children or teens would like such as the music and movies, even though the music sometimes influnce some children to do bad or get off track from being who they really are. I don't understand why take those type things down when you are getting benefits off the things that people buy that will help keep libraries open such as fun rasier type. If you don't have things in a library that will capture a young persons attention like the movies, music, or magazines then children or teens will not be interested on going to libraries. Adults nor teens will sit in a library with under age books, movies, or music. Reason being is, becuase they are muture and not exactly looking for a book with lots of pictures and cartoons unless they are reading to an under age sibling. When that child has to go to library with his or her parent for example to do a project that parent would rather not just sit and wait the whole time for his or her child to finish. That is where the magazines come in ; magazines are very interesting books such as @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS2 @CAPS3 those magazines occupy peoples time while they are waiting just like any other places. Everywhere you go children are going to see things that they shouldn't see at their age, because television and the internet has so many componets that will cause a distraction to a childs mind that will make them question everything they see. That child will soon have to learn. That is how most children are becoming so blunt with the things they do or say, because either they seen it or heard it. I know you @MONTH1 think that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves to keep out of reach of children, but I think that if you are able to separate all upper age group books, movies, music, magazines from all children and other young adults, the library would become more beneficial to everyone that has access to a local library. library\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 89:\n","Essay Text: I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.

The last thing a parent wants is their child to learn something bad from a book and repeat it at school, because that will only lead up to the child getting in serious trouble. Again, I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be banned from the shelves if they are found offensive. Parents do not want to get a phone call from the schoool principal saying their child is using inappropriate language, or being offensive to others. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell wonderful stories, should teach children things that will help them in school, and should not say harmful things about someone or something. Children can learn so much from books, music, movies, magazines, etc., so why make them say offensive or disrespectful things? library\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 90:\n","Essay Text: Censorship In Libraries Do you believe that certain marerials such as books, music movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if found offensive?

There are just to many views on what is explicit to discern between what should be allowed, and what should be expunged. In many cases libraries have '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' in which books, that the majority of people would consider explicit, are held. These @CAPS2 are normally closed off and a person has to exert some sort of physical motion through a barrier in order to enter, therefore they are in full knowledge that there @MONTH1 be offensive literature there. One also must take into account the meaning of the term '@CAPS3 @CAPS4'. That term has a key phrase in the title, @CAPS3, which is almost a warning in itself that the literature in it @MONTH1 be offensive to someone. These points show that there should be no restriction on the books, magazines or music in @CAPS3 libraries. The first topic of discussion is the definition of obscene. There are @NUM1 billion people, in the @LOCATION1 alone, that all have their own views of what they consider obscene to be. If one asked an avid conservative their thoughts on obscenity, they would differ by a tremendous amount of those that a free-spirited individual would have. The inconsistency of views is an obvious reason to keep all types of books in libraries. Not only that but also the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 allows libraries to put grossly obscene literature in a hidden, but accessible area. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are made for one purpose, to sheild the general @CAPS3 of things that would be seen by the majority as obscene. These @CAPS2 are not out in the open where anyone can stumble upon them, they are usually in a corner of the @CAPS4, closed off, and marked '@CAPS1'. These @CAPS2 allow a little bit of compromise between the two sides of the debate for censorship, by still allowing all types of literature, but also sheilding anyone from seeing or hearing any of it unpurposefully. Because of these @CAPS2 there is no way anyone could complain about obscenity in the general @CAPS4 setting. For the libraries without @CAPS1 @CAPS2, there is the warning on the door of the @CAPS4, the word @CAPS3. @CAPS3 libraries are intended for the @CAPS3. Walking into one, under ones own power, dispells any complaints one would have about obscenity. This is because the act of entering a @CAPS3 @CAPS4, puts one in the atmosphere of the @CAPS4, whatever it @MONTH1 be. Libraries should not be held responsible for whether or not the literature on their shelves is offensive. The word @CAPS3 in the term @CAPS3 @CAPS4 is, like said previously, a warning of its own, letting anyone know who is entering that there is a chance there @MONTH1 be some things that person could precieve as obscene. This and multiple other reasons put to rest any thought one would have about removing certain literature from libraries. The three reasons given, along with the many more out there left unsaid, make it inevitable that libraries are not ment to be censored. The fact that the word obscene can not be tailored to fit everyone's personal views, the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and the word @CAPS3 placed infront of @CAPS4, warning everyone any type of literature could be in said @CAPS4, are enough to disspell any thought of censoring libraries. Underground bunkers were designed to sheild and censor the @CAPS3, not libraries. library\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 92:\n","Essay Text: Bad @CAPS1 Should be Removed I think that they schould be taken off of the shelves in libraries.

The reason I think @CAPS1 like this should be taken off of the shelves, is because of little kids coming in and taking them off of the shelves and looking at @CAPS1, that aren't apporate for little childern to see. And older kids looking at them and getting some ideas from them and going home and doing them. Which could cause harm of even death. A personal experience with something like this when I was in fourth grade. Is I went to my teachers bookshelf and picked out a book to take home. That night when I got home I asked my mom if she colud read it to me before I went to bed. So she did and when she opened the book it had alot of bad words in it. That are bad for little childeren to hear. So she to it to the principal the next day and showed it to him and he fired the teacher for having the book on the shelves.

Absolutely, there are many books, magazines, and music selections that should have never reached the shelf. Life has many choices. The people of this world have a choice on what they read or listen to. At a young age we are taught right from wrong. Everyone has different rights and many different wrongs, that they are taught by their parents. It is those morals we our taught that help us decide what we should listen to or what we shoud read. I am a high school student that is very aware of right or wrong. Though my choices @MONTH1 not show as much. I am very aware of what I read and put into my head. Who wants to have certain magazine sex stories in their head? Not me, thats for sure! That makes any guy a perverse guy. I don't read books the tell me how to get in a girl's pants, that is wrong and I belive that should be censored. As a high school guy looking at a girl can be tough on some and then deciding to read about how to get a girl only encourages those types of attitudes. It is the exact same for girls too. Reading wrong stuff puts it into your head. What goes in your head comes out. Music is very influential in todays world. Rap for instence talks about money, sex, and drugs. Like I said garbage in is garbage out. Rap does have a good side too, all music does it is just an example. Then you have rockstars that do the exact same thing. All music depending on the genre you listen to, does say a lot about the person he/ or she is. Christen music does not need to be censored, because it is positive and up-lifting. Not all songs on the radio need to be censored either. Yes the ones talking about sex, drugs, and other terrible things need to be censored. Why would you want to put that stuff in your head? It makes no sense if that is who you want to be, a unintellegent person that no one likes, due to your moods. Movies could do without all the vulgar language and the sex scenes. Movies are meant to be enjoyed. Movies recently have not been family oriented. Transformers for example is a go out with your friends movie. The @CAPS1 series should never have been created. The person that made the @CAPS1 series has a very dark and twisted mind. Scary movies have a purpose for @CAPS3 and other festivities. Scary or not it should have less sex scenes. You should not have to worry what your child is going to see if he/ or she goes out to the movies with friends. Movies play a big part in our economy and that means many adults, teenagers, and children our watching something that is or is not good for their mind and well-being, but movies still have positive impact, jsut depends on what your watching. It is very obvious that our society has different views on, if things should be censored or not. People have their own lifes to lead and live, it is their right to decide what is right and what is wrong. Books, music, and movies influence our society in many ways. Yes some things need to be censored, because music and movies are making some things socially acceptable. When growing up not all things are socially acceptable, or so we are taught. Schools should not censor many books or our music selections, because it is high school it is when we discover ourselves. It is the morals that we are taught that define us, and what we learn from those morals of what is right or wrong to; read, listen to, or watch, that is what builds us as people to grow. You put garbage in your morals with what you do, you are only going to get garbage out library\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 94:\n","Essay Text: During my freshman year there was a lot of controversy over whether or not the classes should be allowed to read 'The @ORGANIZATION1' in school. The debate was due to the fact that there is a rape scene in the book, which many people find too innappropriate for freshman to be reading about. However, it seems to me that we are exposed to offensive things every day and it is not plausible to simply censor every innappropriate thing we come across. In terms of censorship in libraries, it is outlandish to think that we could do the same thing. When people visit libraries, they are there to check out books that they want to read. While there @MONTH1 be many forms of offensive media avaliable to the public through the library, that doesn't mean that people are obligated to view them. We are all perfectly capable of choosing for ourselves what we put into our minds. Because the media advertises offensive things all the time, we cannot block out everything. However we can chose what it is that we want to read when we visit the library. Since it is a choice, it shouldn't be necessary to censor everything there because you don't have to chose to view it. Censorship is also very subjective. What is deemed offensive to someone, @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else. If we oblige to sensor everything anyone claims to be offensive, there would no longer be any forms of media left. This is much like the quote from Katherine Paterson, where she says, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We rid the libraries of what each person finds offensive and what do you have left? Being around things we find offensive is, sadly, a part of life. That does not mean that we have engage in such things. It will never get to a point where everyone is completely happy with the way things are being censored unless everything is done away with, and that would only bring about new issues. We have to have the self control to provide censorship for ourselves, we cannot leave that job to other people. library\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 95:\n","Essay Text: I believe, an artist has the rights to his/her music being sold.

But now I'm glad I didn't buy it. Cause what good would a video game do in the long run. Will it pay bills? No it won't. Will it bring food to the table? No it won't. Will it help you get married? No I think not. The point is the choices made now is what is going to effect you in the long run. I really think its choice.

The library is a great place to barrow free movies and books and magazines if you cant afford to buy any. My family didnt have mony to buy any movies so we would go straight to the library to get free ones. Movies now days are very expinsive to jus be buying all the time.

Absolutely! I believe we should, at least for the children. There are some pretty bad things out there that I do not believe are quite appropriate for children, or even teenagers. If I were a parent, there are many things I would not let my child read or look at. If we don't even give them a chance to see them, then we wouldn't have to worry. Chidren these day are not what they used to be. What would their great grandparents think if they saw the way today's adolescents act, dress, and even talk? Where do you think they get this from? The answer is simple. They get it from today's movies, books, music, and magazines. We cannot keep going on like this or eventually we will have toddlers acting inappropriately! I know from experience that when children are small and they see or hear something, it sticks with them for a long time. If child is looking through a magazine and they see a questionable picture, they are not likely to forget that picture very soon. Or if they are listening to a song with bad words, don't be surprised if they do not forget them or even start repeating them. That is just how small children are. My last point is the fact that parents would probably be much happier if offensive material was removed from libraries. Parents would be able to bring their children to the library and not have to worry about what they are looking at or listening to. The children would feel a sense of freedom and the parents would, in return, feel a sense of reassurance. Offensive material should definitely be removed from our libraries in order to keep our children pure and their parents happy. I understand that others would argue that if we take out offensive material then eventually, there would be nothing left for our children to read.

Childrens music should be in the kids section along with the books, magazines and movies. Doing this for the children will keep them away from unappriate music, books, maganzies and movies.

These meterials could consist of nude pictures and so on. Most parents do not want to see there kids getting a hold of this type of material. You maybe think 'what could we do about this things, or least come to a compermise to make almost everyone happy. I have so reasons why we should put this type of material away from kids sight and reach. First of all, the books and magizines that have any nude in them, should have their own section and, be labled aduts only. I know this might be alot of work but it is needed, so kids aren't aloud to go in ths section. This will help ruduce what little kids see. There are also books and magizines that are offensive to children of a different race. These books should be removed from the shelves also because they hert peoples feelings, and this might make customers leave your libary. I am not saying ouhae to take ever single book of your selves, but a least reduce the number of books of your selves out of kids eyes mostly and some adults if they are offended. Next thing that comes to mind is the music on compacked discs, or cd's which ever you perfere. In this day and age there are alot of musicians out there that have alot of bad words in their songs. These songs; are songs parents dont like there children to listen to, because parents are afraid of their children here these words and repeating them at home. These type of cd's should be taken of shelves where kids are, and put in a section also labled adults only. I know this wont stop kids from hearing these words and say them, but at least the parents can blame you for their child saying these words, because you did the smart thing and put these cd's out of kids reach. There are songs that are ofensive to people but i know you cant go throught every song and take them off the shelves, but a least take the cd's off the shelve that you know are offensive to people. The last that comes to mind that should be taken off the shelves that are material children shouldnt see is the movies. There are movies out there that are to graphic, to vilent, and to much nudity that kids dont need to see. These type of movies need to also get a section that is for adults only. Then you have the movies that need to just be taking off the shelve because they are to offensive to some viewers. I know that you @MONTH1 say but if it is offensive to them, they dont have to get it. This maybe true but a least move the to a section that those people that get offended dont go. Those were my thoughts on what should be done with material thats to offensive and not aprobriet for eyes or minds.These might be a little extreme but i hope you at least take some of these things into consideration. You cant please all but you can try. Thanks for reading this and i hope it as changed your thoughts on material thats bad for kids to see censorship\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 104:\n","Essay Text: I strongly believe that there are some materials that should not be allowed on the shevles. There are things in this world that kids should not see for a long time. If there are things that are offensive on the shelves, then kids can read it and it could lead to bad things. When you enter a library, you don't want to see something that is very offensive. For example, one time my friend and I walked in to the library and the first thing we saw was a book about inappropiate things. We were young so that was the last thing we wanted to see. It was a horrible thing to see and I feel that no child should have to see that when they go into a library. You can never unsee things. No parent wants their children going into a library and reading things they shouldn't. It @MONTH1 have an affect on their childrens behavior and future. If a child went into a library and began reading a book about drugs it could hurt their future. If the book was telling them that drugs aren't always bad, then that kid @MONTH1 grow up thinking it is okay to do drugs. This could really ruin someones life. I know that this @MONTH1 not always be true,but it could be in some cases. If I was to walk into a library today, there probably wouldn't be to many things found offensive. I feel that as the years go on, there are less inappropriate things found on the shelves at libraries because people ask them to remove the book if it is offensive. If I was to find something bad there I would ask them to remove it from the shelf. I believe that everyone should have the right to remove a book from the shelf if it is offensive. I also think that eveyone would need a good reason to remove it because eventually there wouldn't be very many books left on the shelves. I believe that these are all very good reasons to removes offensive books off the shelves at libraries. I hope that most would agree that no one should have to see these offensive books when they enter a library. censorship\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 105:\n","Essay Text: Do you think that certain books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves in a library if found offensive?Sometimes they should if found offensive by alot of people.Sometimes books are found offensive by a few people and the books should not be band.

It is history for everyone in the world to know. Sure it @MONTH1 bug some people that stuff like that is being written about them; however, they probably read material about you like that as well. How is that fair? Words in the library are just people's opinions about other people, groups, or other things. Sure there are facts about what that group or person did, but that's history. People need to know what happened in the past so they can move on in the future. Books about slavery @MONTH1 be offensive to blacks, but now that people have read about it and what it caused, they realize how inhumane and bad it is. It's necesarry information to learn. People who get mad at libraries for carrying that material in their books just can't let go of the past or they care too much about what other people think. As far as movies and music go, they are just informative videos about @LOCATION1's history, and music is for entertainment. You can't take all things you see hear in a literal way. They are not meant to be taken in an 'in your face' sort of way. It's not like there isn't another movie out there making fun of the one that offended you. Libraries carry this reading/learning material to help inform the less than average person or the more than average so they can both become smarter. Libraries aren't made to make people angry about what some guy thought or said once. It is just a place to gain knowledge. If you don't want to let your child have access to information like that then I suggest that you don't let them go to the library ever. That's is what it was made for and will always be made for. Yeah the person who wrote that book or movie @MONTH1 not have gotten their information from a reliable source and said some false things about a group or person. It happens. But they are stilling trying to educate the reader. Education is what makes our world survive. We have to keep learning and the library makes that oppurtunity available with all the information it holds. Libraries should keep every book that they have. If people take offense to it, read something else. There are far too many opinions in this world to take one person's and get mad about it. Libraries are centers of education. They hold the information to our past and possibly our future. If we are willing to learn about what happened and accept it. Once again, it's not meant to cause anger among groups or people. So do what you do best and keep writing stories you hear about in the news or anywhere.

I believe that these books, movies, music, magazines, should be kept on the shelves. There are many reasons for keeping these books for the public, one main one is that who ever has a membership to the library paid to see everything. These books that are found offensive to some @MONTH1 not be offensive to others, heres an example, lets say there is a recovering alcoholic and this person is flipping through a magazine and they see a alcoholic beverage ad in the magazine. This would be offensive to them but to the person next to him that collects fine wines its not offensive to him. This is all a matter of opinion, another example, there is a magazine that comes in that has a ammo add and one of the librarians finds it bad, but the others like to hunt game and they find it helpful to read an ad about ammounition for their next vacation to alaska. As i said before it is all a sense of oppinions. Its one persons oppinion aganist others and its a never ending cycle, and its never going to stop. Basically this censorship is a game of he said , she said, and it is not fair to the people to take something away just because a few people do not like it. Some people found racial profiling offensive others did not, some people seen what @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was doing was right, others didnt. Everyone has an opinion and everyone will express theirs no matter what its about, why they say it, and how you or anyone else feels, and that is how it will be until the end of time, and thats life. So holding books back just because a group of peoples opinion is outragous! This is a free country and we should be able to know that by not having people hide stuff just because a slight offense is brought into play. This is my opinion on this matter and some @MONTH1 take offense to it, just hear me out when i say why let someone tell you what you can and cant read? Thats just wrong.

Should libraries be only child friendly? Censorship in public libraries isn't the answer to solve the problem with children in desiding on what books they want to explore. Public libraries have the title 'public' for a reason. Taking good books off shelves, that @MONTH1 not be good books for @PERSON1 children, instead should be catagorized in sections for @PERSON1 children, pre-teens, teenagers, and adults. I beleive that censorship of libraries would be a very ignorant idea. Not to mention that it would create an uproar in the public tax payers. I don't beleive tax payers would appreciate that their tax money isn't going toward things that actually matter. A lot of the public @MONTH1 like those books and other media sources that's being taken away, @CAPS1 some @MONTH1 find the books offensive, but that dosen't mean that they have to get rid of the book, when they can just put the book down. I do beleive that everyone should have a say in their public libraries to improve them, not disprove them. @PERSON1 children should be restricted from the sections that are not appropriate for their age and should be rederected to locations of sections that are appropriate for their age. Censorship on this subject means sealing other ideas off and away from the public eyes. Some of those ideas can educate people very well with quality knowledge or not, but are brain candy and just are fun to read. If people like Paterson are concerned about what @PERSON1 readers can read and uptain, they should be monitering what their children are reading and allow them or not, not the libraries. The libraries just carry the book. Books that are offensive @MONTH1 show the reader new and interesting ideas. Some for example like 'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1' show what life was like in that time.

I went to the computers to see if my favorite book available. The computer showed that the book was taken off the shelf for offending readers. I checked another list that listed numerous books, music, movies, and magazines that were also taken off of the shelves. Half of the list, I had checked out already. The librarian said the council is voting to take or not take specific books, music, movies, and other items off of the shelves for offensive content. As a regular library customer, I felt I needed to express my opinion of the topic. I believe that before these materials are taken off of the shelves that the librarians need to consider an age limit, a 'three strikes your out' rule, or how much these materials mean to people. Offending people is not what these materials are meant to do. Some books can be perceived in that way which makes the readers angry. I can understand someone's feelings being hurt by a certain topic of reading, but that person @MONTH1 not be mature enough to comprehend what the book is intending as a message. My sister who is the age of ten has read a book which offended her, but she also didn't know what the book really was about. I believe that anyone the age of sixteen or older should be allowed access to these books, music, movies, and magazines. Age sixteeen is when most people are already in high school and more mature. Anyone younger than that shouldn't be allowed access to these items. If the readers are mature enough to handle the material, then people @MONTH1 not be offended as much. Another new rule the library could try is the 'three strikes you're out rule.' @CAPS1 rule is when someone behaves inappropriately. Some people who behave inappropriately will tell everyone the book is offensive and make up stories about the book so their friends will laugh. Each person receives a strike every time they behave inappropriately. @CAPS1 includes in a school classroom as well as the library. After a certain amount of strikes, that person wouldn't be allowed to check out the material. The librarians could keep a record of @CAPS1 which could be accessed whenever. Even if the person is of age to check out the material, they couldn't do so if they had a certain amount of strikes on their record. These materials mean a great deal to people. I am an avid reader as well as movie watcher. When I read a book, I feel like I have freedom. No one is telling me I perceive the book wrong, or that isn't what the character would look like. Reading a book is my own imagination making up the pictures of the story in my head. Taking these items off of the shelves takes away people's immagination. It also takes away from the writers freedom of speech in the @CAPS2 of @CAPS3. The writers wrote their book under that @CAPS2 and now there freedom is basically being taken away from them by taking there speech off of shelves. Overall, I believe that these materials shouldn't be taken off of the shelves. The librarians should consider either making up new rules or thinking about people's opinions of the subject. The librarians should also consider the freedom of speech rule when they are taking these materials off of the shelves. If they don't consider any of these options, then all offensive materials would be taken away. One person could say a book or movie is offensive and it would be taken off of the shelf. After awhile, the library would eventually become empty.

I do not believe that certain books should be taken off the shelf just for the kind of material that it is.If other people don't like the material in the book then they don't have to read it.Some people learn things from lessons that are learned the hard way.So maybe if they didn't like the book because of the way it was written,they should read it anyways.Offensive books can teach people lessons about how other things in the world are. Not everything that people read is going to be nice.Just like everything in the world isn't nice but we deal with it anyways.There's always going to be a really offensive person in the word,but you can't just take them off the shelve becuase that person is mean or you don't like what he's saying.If we killed every offensive person in the world, there would be barely any people left.

So my answer is no, no books, music, movies, magazines should be banned from the library because one person, or mabye the majority of people find it offensive. There is no reason to tarnish anyone elses reading, listening, or watching anything of their interest because others find it offensive. The solution that could solve all this, is for the people that find them offensive, can just completely ignore that material.I can understand by my own experiences how people can find such materials a problem though. For an example, I've read books, listened to music, watched movies, even read magazines that were offensive too me. The biggest problem that occurs in those materials to make them offensive, is usually racism. Most people can deal with it though, so if they can you should be able to, right? As I have stated before, just because you don't like it does not mean that you should disapprove of it. If you disapprove of it and get the material removed from the library then the others who liked it, won't be able to read, listen, nor watch it.The statement I'm making here, is me pretty much saying that onless you only care about yourself, then sure report about it.If you are not a person that only cares of yourself, then you would let the book stay even though you don't like it, because others @MONTH1 like it. My observations of this sort of thing is I've seen people complain how they've read this book, and it was racist towards their well-being.

So what do you do about this situation? Yes, there might be some books that could be offensive to people if they are about certain things. What if a little kid is in the adult area looking at books and they find a book they shouldn't have seen? Well most parents would want those books to be removed from the library. There could also be books that are just offensive to adults because of what they are about. I've seen people at my library get offended by something they read and they didn't want it back on the shelf. What if there are some @CAPS1's that a little kid checks out and it has language in the music? I don't think that any of that music should be in the library at all. Especially with little kids roaming the library. The music in the library could be offensive to other people to. Not just young kids. When you walk into a library usually the first thing you see are magazines. There can be some pretty inapropriate magazines with inapropriate covers. Is this really what you want people looking at? Especially young kids? There are also movies at a library. Yes, most of them are old movies, but some of them are also kids movies. What if one of those old movies had a bad cover on it, or bad language? A lot of movies are also offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3. I think this because, back in the old days there was a lot of racism, and that is still in alot of movies now. There could also be movies against someones religion. That could be very offensive to certain people. Most of this stuff in libraries can be offensive to young kids because of the covers. Some can be offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because of racism. I think that if you have a problem with something that you see on a shelf, you should tell the librarian and see if they will take it off the shelf. You shouldn't have to be offended by something at the library. I think that people should have their rights to get certain materials off of the shelf.

And why somethings do not need to be sensored at the library. I will help you to understand what young teenagers or younger children should and should not be able to see or borrow from the library. There are somethings that should be kept from the kids eyes. What are some of the movies, books, or magazines that should be hidden from children? This is probably what you are woundering. The first thing that kids should not be allowed to borrow would be movies that have any that is over there age requirement to see at the movie theather. The reason this is so that the teenager or young child does not watch anything that @MONTH1 scary them. Another thing that should not be seen would be the movies that are meant for a mature veiwer meaning an adult viewer. There are a few books that kids should not be able to read until they are an adult. And these books would be the ones that have a harsh backround on past events that happened. Like what happen during a war to a captured soldier or a prisoner of war. And what they to go through during their imprisonment. These are the books that should be hidden from younger childern. There are some movies, books, music, magazines that do not need to be sensored for people to see. Starting with why some movie do not need to be sensored. First is because most movies are funny but have just a little need of maturity. These movies are the ones that have alot of comedy and as most adults know most kids are into the funny movies. So why take away a movie that is something a kid would have a great time watching. There are some books that should probably be read by adults but there are some teenagers that are mature enough to read this stories. Or if they need to learn about a specific topic for school work they should be allowed to read that book. I do not think that any genre or group of music should be sensored. This because music is a way for someone to express themselves without even having to truely say anything. about who they are or what kind of a mood they are in. music does much more then just that though it helps some people vent on there anger or even how sad they @MONTH1 be. But in conclusion I think there are many things that are good but still need to be sensored for most of the young childern and teenagers to be able to see.

Then again I think the children should be reading on there own level, but for that to happen we would have to trust our children to know what kind of material they should be looking at and what they shouldnt be looking at. Alot of younger kids come into the library not even knowing how to read and go right to the advanced section just to be cool, the library is not a place to come to act cool. Its for learning new things and advancing your reading level. If things keep going the way they are all of our books will be gone except for all the little kid books becuase those are the only things that dosnt get checked out. so please local library would you please think about puting rating labels on the cover of everything in the library so we can put some order into this place.

No matter who that person is we all have something that is offensive to us and thats that. This does not mean we need to take books off the shelves of libraries that some author spent his time an money on. Books in libraries are either in there for informational use or just to hear a good story. No author is going to try an offend any one in anything thier writting. Why would they do that if they want their book to be well liked and bought? Truth is no one wants to be offended or talked about in a hastily way. There is no need for censorship in libraries. Libraries were made for educational information, history, and non-fiction tales to please our minds. If we censored all of this how would we learn what's good, what's bad, and what's acceptable in life. If a book, movie, magazine, or music is to graphic or not apropriate for that person then they should just not look at it or view it. It's clear that every human being is different and special in their own way. We all have our own idea on what we think is right, wrong, and just plain offensive.

I believe they should allow these certain category of books, movies, and magazines to be allowed, however to an extent. Libraries should open up an area for people above the age of @NUM1 to view this material with a special membership. Books and magazines in libraries are, and should be seperated by categories. The books and magazines that could be considered 'highly offensive,' do not belong on the library shelves at all. However, books and magazines that give out informative data with proper conduct should be allowed. If libraries create an area in which peoples' prefrences are to view content over the age of @NUM1, they should be required to have their own membership. In order to even look at material that is uncensored, visitors need a special pass; this way people who get offended by material that is not censored do not have to pass it while inside the library. Many people who do not want to go out and spend @MONEY1 on a movie rental like to go to the library. Libraries should allow movies from the ranges of ratings @CAPS1(@CAPS2) to @CAPS3(@CAPS4) to be on the shelves of the library. Going into a public library should not have any more restrictions that going into a public video store. However, videos that are considered 'pornography,' should not be in any part of the library. Just like in a public video store, libraries should not contain any footage that is considered pornography. Much of the popular music today is considered offensive. The music in libraries can still be the same songs, but they need to have clean content in them. I believe that edited music in libraries is okay under any circumstances. I do not believe that explicit music is okay. People inside the library could be listening to this explicit music before they take it home, while others in the library get offended by it. People overhearing music would not happen often, but we need to make sure it does not happen at all. Overall, material in libraries that could be considered offensive should not be allowed to be viewed except under special memberships that have proof that an individual is over the age of @NUM1. We all need to work together to make sure our libraries stay clean and unoffensive.

Sure im sure libraries in communist countries take books off the shelves, but that's because theyre communist! If you take away freedoms of people then eventually our counrty will become one of those communist countries nobody wants. Why would anyone not be able to read a good book its a story. Music is music no matter what they say in the lyrics, and movies if you get rid of movies well then whats the @LOCATION1 coming to certainly not a free country. I enjoy all kinds of different movies. Lets see I like dramas, comedys, horror, and action movies they're all great! So what if its a little rasict or sextist all its doing is telling a story.

So if you ask me people that want to take books, movies, and music out of libraries to protect people then that means your just trying to protect yourself. Maybe a section in the library should be made saying these books @MONTH1 be offensive to some people.

Well I believe that can be fix, because not everything you say do not have to be with a vulgar word or end with one. Music is not about '@CAPS1, @CAPS2, or even @CAPS3', music suppose to make you feel good inside or maybe even down in some people cases, but music is a positive fact and people do not suppose to turn something positive into negative. Books are influencional on me because I like to read, I enjoying reading books that I can relate to and understand cause most people can read something and not understand a thing. As little kids we all were tought to pick up a book and read but as we get older we fall off, but what people do not know is, books help develop your reading and vocabulary skills. Even if you read a magazine, anything would help as long as your reading something. Magazines are basically about the world, celebritys and how the media react, but like a book a magazine do not stick with one topic. Movies especially movies are a big deal in the world.

That would make someone who really like the book that they took alway upset. Libraries are suppose to have books that everyone can read and learn from, so if they don't have books for everyone the library should'nt be there. I disagree with removing certain material from the library and here is why. First, the reason why i would'nt remove certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc., because the library is a place where people come to learn about new things. Just because one person does'nt like the book does'nt make it right for them to remove it. If people don't wont their children to read the book don't let them go to the library. They go buy their child some good books to read. Also, no one would want to go to a library that does'nt have what they are looking for. That would'nt be a good look for the library, because if someone goes there and find that all the books their looking for is not in and this is the only library in town they would never want to go back there again. Then they would tell moe people about how that library does'nt have anything your looking for in it. Then, the library would get old close down then get knocked down, and in the shot were the library use to be would be a mini mall, food store, ect. so i really don't think it's a good idea to take book off the shelves at the libraries. We need those books because you never know when something can come up and you need that one book that is not there. In conclusion, removing books from the shelves is a bad thing to do.

Kid's reading offensive things and seeing offensive things will hurt them due to them still learning basic things in life. Once when I was little, I picked up and read a book about drugs and sex. They talked about how they feel, where you can get them from, and what they looked like. For a minor reading on how to get drugs and use them, that's telling them to much. It is not a good thing to tell kid's so early in their life about drugs because, they are going to get curious about how the drugs feel. When I was told about drugs I was very curious and I wanted to learn more about them. The older and boring we become the more we will want to try the drugs we learned about earlier in our lives. More people every day try drugs because there is nothing else to do. When I learned about sex while being a kid made me want to try it because they made it sound good in books. Being teached offensive things in libraries is a bad thing because, who would think something bad could be in a library? You go to the library to learn good things about life and if their are offensive things in books and in writing you will pick them bad things up in your life.

If they think that book is too offensive should they be allowed to take it off the shelf? Should they just complain to the librarian? Some people will have very different opinions when answering these questions. What's the right answer though? The way I see it, they should not be allowed to take it off of the shelf. Everyone has different interests. People @MONTH1 read one specific type of book and only that type. Others will read all types. Some people @MONTH1 think that books are too scary, violent, or sexual. Others @MONTH1 enjoy the thrill in them and want to read these books. There are many ways in which a book could be inappropriate. This, however, does not mean libraries should have censorship. Libraries should have sections that are age appropriate. That way if a book is too bad in some way then the mature audience would read it and an audience that should be reading children's books would not be in that section. Another reason they should not be allowed to take books off of shelves is because it's disrespectful to the author. The author took a long time creating their book aimed towards a specific audience. For someone to take it off a shelf and ruin peoples chances for being able to read that is awful and it should not be allowed. Taking a book off of the shelf is like and author coming up and destroying all of the hard work you have worked for. Many people might find a book that is very inappropriate and want it to be disposed of but as you can see, its not right. There would be no books left on the shelves.

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exaclty the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' -@ORGANIZATION1 quote moves mountians with its wisdom. In @ORGANIZATION1 day and age, many of the things we read/see in magazines, movies, the news etc. are considered to be quite offensive to many. Would a mother of a fifteen year old be upset if @CAPS5 found her daughter reading a magazine that stated, 'safe sex is great sex', or a father finding his teenage son watching a movie with pornographic scenes? The answer is no. The magazines, movies, music and books that are being sent out into libraries all over the world are not exactly '@CAPS1 rated' and many adults would be shocked to realize exactly what it is teenagers are viewing; but is it right to then remove everything some one finds to be wrong or offensive? Lets think about religion for a second. Atheists would find the bible to be a lie, maybe even find it offensive. So in turn to be considerate of their beliefs does that make it 'right' to remove the bible from libraries and open access to the public? Think about the novel, 'To @CAPS2 a @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. English scholars around the world will state that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a novel of its time; that it will continue to be read hundreds of years from now at schools around the world. Some though, would find @ORGANIZATION1 book offensive. The word 'nigger' is placed in @ORGANIZATION1 novel many times and is set in a time when slavery is not frowned apon. Just because one parent finds @ORGANIZATION1 book to be offensive does that mean students from all over should no longer be allowed to read it; that @ORGANIZATION1 book should be 'removed from the shelves?' The questions posed here are not simple questions, they require much time and thought. If a survey was posted asking: Should certain materials be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? The outcome would be intangible to think about now, considering people have many different views on the aspect. In reading @ORGANIZATION1 and contemplating the questions asked you will realize that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a black or white concept; there lies a large area of grey in the middle. Something that one @MONTH1 find offensive, another would not; something a teenager views as interesting an adult @MONTH1 view as crude or vulger. Does @ORGANIZATION1 mean that everything would be taken down from the shelves then? Yes. In the quote above by Katherine Paterson, @CAPS5 states, '.. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS5 is correct in @ORGANIZATION1 because @CAPS5 realizes that everyone has different views on what is appropriate or not. @ORGANIZATION1 statement shows that although libraries @MONTH1 allow inappropriate novels, magazines, tapes etc. to be open to the easy access of customers there is no way that they would be able to make everyone feel content without completely wiping out the building of its contents. The right to take a book away also is a right to leave it; leave the books then and let the ones who enjoy them, simply enjoy. censorship\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 126:\n","Essay Text: We have all read a book or heard a song that has offended us or just didn't catch our intrest, right?

I'll begin by asking; what is censorship? Think about that question while you're reading, or stop and think a moment before you continue. I hope what I have to say will give you a clear idea or a new perspective, and that you might understand what I think the importance of censorship in libraries really means, and not just to me, but to all who pick up a book. To answer my previous question, censoring is the removing of suggestive or otherwise offensive materials from any or all sources of information, or entertainment. Now I'll ask another question; why do we have censorship? Most believe that all children have a right to know things they'll learn about eventually whether or not they want to, and therefore don't care when their children are exposed to that knowledge. Those people don't consider the consequences of that knowledge in the wrong hands, or wrong minds. Children don't think on the same track that most adults do, and therefore are incapable of handling certain knowledges that adults have long since known and otherwise dealt with. Those who know of the consequences of certain knowledges in the wrong minds have tried to keep the information from those who can't or shouldn't worry about them untill they're older and more capable of understanding what it all means. A lot of ideas we have @DATE1, from science and technology, from philosophical thinking to common sense, most everything has been written down in the past, or is being written @DATE1. That's where the problems arise. Almost everything is written about or recorded in some way, therefore increasing the chances that someone will hear or see this knowledge and, not knowing it's importance, might even abuse it eventually. Think about the crimes that go on @DATE1. Are all of them simple? Do they all focus on the same things? How do they come about? All these questions are able to be answered in the simplest ways; the people who commited them learned about something too early in life and grew up thinking it was ok, whether they learned it from books, or music, or movies, etc., and eventually repeated these things they learned. Of course that's not always the case, but for those people who don't know why so many people ended up as the people who get thrown into jail, or get into trouble, a major factor is what they learn at an early age, and not having sensible people to help them to know what's right and what's wrong. To conclude, I think the best ways to avoid the wrong information getting into the wrong hands, is to have censorship in libraries. Without it, people can just walk up to any shelf and pick up that one book, even a nine-year-old child. censorship\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 130:\n","Essay Text: Some books, music, movies, and magazines or other types of information or entertanment are innapropriate. I dont believe that they should be removed from the library or other puplic places for that reason though. You have to take a lot into conciteration before decideing weather it should be censored or not. Age is one aspect. If the material is not sutable to a sertain age then it should be organized into a different age category according to the library. I believe that there should be age limits like the ones they have on movies or video games. Rescently there was a book, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, that was questioned on the use of language in it. I think that the author wrote their book the way they want it and would like it sold that way not have it censored. If you find something offensive that doesen't mean you should keep getting involved with it. If there is a book or movie that is offfensive to you, you can stop reading or stop watching it at your own will. Often on the radio there are songs that use innapropriate language and it is bleeped out. Why should we bleep it? Some people could find it more offensive to hear it bleeped than to hear the words just said. And thier oppinion should be the one that counts. The questin weather there should be censorship in libraries is all about a persons perspecitve. Someone is always going to see it differently than you. There is nothing bad about that. I remember watching a show one time and there were these characters in a book club and they were debateing the book its self. Not always is everyone going to like your oppinion of something but you shouldn't despise people for that.

There's a certain point to where yeah things should not be writen or films that should'nt have been made but if you dont like it, then dont read it and or watch it.

Thats like the @ORGANIZATION2 not having any football just because the players feel like they dont get payed enough @MONEY1 to play it.

Imagine a little girl about the age of four walking through differnce sections of books in a library when she finds a book that cacthes her eye in the adult section. The book is baby blue and has a little bird on it. However, the book also has a half naked man on cover besided the cute little bird. The girl grabs the book and goes happly to find her mom. When the mom looks at the book her face is in shock. What would you do if that was your daughter? Most likely we'd put the book back and explain why she can't have it. While, others would go screaming to the check out and asking, 'how is it possible that my daughter got this? Shouldn't the libraries be wacthing the kids to make sure they don't go in that section?'. I believe that certain materials, such as books,movies, ect., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact people will still find way to get the removed material and that it's just a part of life. My first reason that certain materials, such as books, shouldn't be pulled from are shelves is that we live in a nation that prides it's self as the '@CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. That doesn't mean we get everything for @CAPS2 when we go to a store it just simple means that you, the people of @LOCATION1, have the freedom and right to speak your mind. So you can say whatever you want in newspapers or in books because the government gives you that right. However, you can't say 'I have a bomb' at the airports because of the many attacks the nation has encountered over the years, but that's common sences. My second reason that certain materials should say on the put, even if someone is offened by it is that no matter how many books or movies you take of the store shelves, the people will find a way to get them. One way to get them is the black market where people sell drugs and weapons. Do we, as a country really need another drug on the market even if it's a book? I think not. Also, if you look at the whole picture people will be losing jobs because the televison today is not the kind they had back in your grandma's day. Nearly @PERCENT1 of everything on televison has something to do with the little three letter s-word every parent hates to talk about. You might be thinking that if we take the unrated movies and the books with the naked men on the cover we'd be saving are children which leads me to my last point. Seeing unrated movies and such is a part of life. So what are you saving them from? Children sooner or later will grow up and learn about the types of subject matter so why take it off when you will have to teach them about it sooner rather then later? Millions of parents around the @CAPS3 each and every year have to teach their kids about the birds and the bees. It's a part of growing up in a way. Now a days though, the birds and the bees are all people seem to talk about. So like it or not your kids will find out just like you did and your parents before you. Plus, your not going to make everyone happy. Someone will always be offened by something. Imagine. Imagine that same little girl, now an adult, having to deal with that same issue of the same baby blue book with the same little bird with the half naked man on the cover. The truth is that this way my mother when she was little and it turns out that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree because I had the same issue as well. I know that one day I will also have the same issue as my mother did before me. So I believe that certain materials, such as books and movies, shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact that people will still find a way to get the removed material and that it's just apart of life.

The media should be for everyone to enjoy and not have to worry about offensive material. In @DATE1's world there are offensive media out there and they often start up problems. We need to do something about this problem. If there are offensive media out there the kids of the future are going to look up to them and try to be like them or hate the same thing that the media does. Let's just say there was a song about school and how people dont like it don't you think our kids are going to hate school too? I don't think that is right. We need to teach our kids that school is very important and not to take in what the media says because they are not always right. We want enjoyable media in the world. We want good things for our future kids to see and hear. We don't want kids picking up bad words. We need to watch what we put out in the world. If there is something offensive remove it from the shelves as soon as possible or just not put it out to the public at all. Offensive media can often start up problems in the world. Weither it's in the @CAPS2.S or somewhere around the world. If a book talks about how bad a certain race is those people that were disliked in the book are going to get even with the people who made the book or other media. Many issues @DATE1 are over media out there in the world. People that work at libraries should keep an eye out for offensive materals and shoud remove them to prevent even more problems. I'm sure libraries all around the world have some kind of offensive media in it. We need to stand up and fight to get rid of all offensive media and make the world a better place.

Truth be told, there are many ways for our offspring to not have the availability of those books. There is what I believe to be an appropriate division on the materials in our libraries and bookstores, the fact that we can always monitor what our children read and watch, and not to mention that we can use the internet to back up any doubts we have on the literature and lyrics.The question that remains is: Are we using the ways of preventing this problem to the best of our abilities? I believe that our public libraries and bookstores do a splendid job of diviying up what is deemed appropriate for each age group. Teens know a fairly good amount more about things than all parents invision they shouldn't, and I think the bookstores and libraries keep the youths knowledge in what they're listening, watching, and reading to what these kids already know. Comparing what is considered a 'young adult' book and an 'adult' book, you will find an atrocious difference. Young adult books only hint around things such as drugs, refraining from abstinence, and grisly murder scenes whereas adult books go into a great deal more detail. Middle school level children's books are even more less detailed than teen books, so it is save to say that as long as the parents are directing their child into the appropriate section in anyone's given local library, they will be in good hands. There's also the option of monitering what our young ones are listening to. By simply being interested in what it is that the child is singing or humming along to, us parents would find that they wouldn't be reluctant to let on about what was being said. If in any case we feel that the lyrics are too harsh for the kid, we are still their parents and have the right to deem it as something they shouldn't be listening to and suggest something different to them and/or ban them from being able to listen. In @CAPS1 cases though, we should try to listen to what our kids are. In this way, we can be reassured that the range of materials they're plugging into their ears are not what we would consider to be grotesque for something our children's age. Another useful tool would have to be the internet. If we don't feel the need to ask about the literature or music, but @MONTH1 still have a few doubts, there are plenty of book and music blogs across the world wide web that can help us out. Even by going to a bookstore website and reading the description about the book, or a lyric website that will tell us what is being said, or even a movie website where we can see a rating and the content of the movie, and the comments left by people that go with it respectively, @CAPS1 of us would find all of the information we need. Even author's, director's, and artist's websites would be useful. Looking at their discussions would be a big help as well, considering that @CAPS1 of these people have a vision of what age groups would be attracted to their material. In conclusion, I think our children are fairly wise about what they choose to read, listen to, and watch, but then again, it all depends on the preference. Not every child is the same, just as not any adult, or any one person. The prefernce tends to lean towards the things we think are appropriate. Paying attention to what the young ones are like says alot about what they read, and what they listen to and watch, for that matter. We have all these ways of keeping our children from reading, watching and listening to inappropriate things, we just have to make them and asset censorship\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 136:\n","Essay Text: For many years libraries have had books, magazines, and movies posted in their shelves of the library that are very offensive to many people. Many people ask how is it ok for that material to be open to teenagers and possibly children. In my opinion I think that it is not right for libraries not to do anything about this problem, especially when this is happening across the nation. In large department stores such as @ORGANIZATION1, you are required to be eighteen years old to purchase adult items, sometimes you must be twenty-one years of age. It is considered illegal for anyone under the required age to purchase an item with an age limit on it. Music is a totally different type of profanity, @CAPS1 albums are sold with much innapropiate material in them that is open to the public, but the @CAPS1's sold in stores are usually edited into a more appropiate version. Days like today nearly no one ever buys @CAPS1's anymore, its all about @CAPS4's and @NUM1's where all you have to do is find your song on a site and download it for free in about four to five seconds. It would not surprise me if libraries had music and @CAPS1's with just as much adult profanity, and language that is not edited out. So if most of the things in this world that are adult rated and can not be purchased unless your considered an adult by age, why should it be ok to viewed by any age in a library. I myself believe that it should be illegal for materials such as the ones mentioned to be banned or atleast taken more respected with the viewer of the materials. It would really hurt a parent for them to take a kid to a library and tell them to go find a book they like, and they return to their mother or father with an adult book with many things a child or possibly a teenager should not see. I believe times like those could tear a parent or even a grandparent apart, having to explain to their children or grandchildren what they just saw. Because most of us know that most children always want to know what something is when they see it, and for a parent to have to explain to their child at that age has to be heart-stopping. In all of this that I have explained is only my opinion, but I believe many other millions of people agree with me. If it is not aloud almost everywhere else in this world, why should it be ok a library to do it? Is it because its some little rule about freedom of decision? Do libraries think just because they are old fashioned and have been here longer than the @CAPS1's, @CAPS4's, and @NUM1's that they dont have to follow rules and guidelines. It is a shame that they are ruining the lives and visions of the children and teens today to think its ok for anyone to see, listen, or watch these materials. censorship\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 137:\n","Essay Text: There are many books in the libraries.

I say no that the books, music, movies, or magazines should not be removed from libraries, because if the books or etc. are that offensive, those things shouldn't be in childrens reach anyway. There should be a section limit where children can't go by to get to the offensive type books and others. Why take things that older people would insist on looking at off the shelf just because someone didn't separate the adult books and etc., from the childrens. Taking away the things that adults look at would be just as bad as taking the things that children or teens would like such as the music and movies, even though the music sometimes influnce some children to do bad or get off track from being who they really are. I don't understand why take those type things down when you are getting benefits off the things that people buy that will help keep libraries open such as fun rasier type. If you don't have things in a library that will capture a young persons attention like the movies, music, or magazines then children or teens will not be interested on going to libraries. Adults nor teens will sit in a library with under age books, movies, or music. Reason being is, becuase they are muture and not exactly looking for a book with lots of pictures and cartoons unless they are reading to an under age sibling. When that child has to go to library with his or her parent for example to do a project that parent would rather not just sit and wait the whole time for his or her child to finish. That is where the magazines come in ; magazines are very interesting books such as @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS2 @CAPS3 those magazines occupy peoples time while they are waiting just like any other places. Everywhere you go children are going to see things that they shouldn't see at their age, because television and the internet has so many componets that will cause a distraction to a childs mind that will make them question everything they see. That child will soon have to learn. That is how most children are becoming so blunt with the things they do or say, because either they seen it or heard it. I know you @MONTH1 think that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves to keep out of reach of children, but I think that if you are able to separate all upper age group books, movies, music, magazines from all children and other young adults, the library would become more beneficial to everyone that has access to a local library. censorship\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 139:\n","Essay Text: I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.

Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories, should teach lessons, and should not be offensive. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories. When I sit down to read a book or magazine, or to watch a movie, I want to read or watch an interesting story. A little child is not going to want to read a book about history or science, they will want to read about @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @LOCATION2, or @ORGANIZATION1. Children will not sit still unless they have something to read or watch that is interesting and appealing to them. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should teach lessons. I believe that libraries should have books, magazines, etc., that teach them how to tie their shoes, to count, or to say the alphabet. Children love to sing, so simply put a @CAPS3 in that sings the alphabet, and the child will be singing along shortly. When a child pulls a book off of the shelf at a library, that shows a pretty picture, the child will be attracted to it, and learn as they read or watch. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be offensive. Kids should not read a book, magazine, etc., if the author is talking about harming someone or something. If the book, magazine, etc., has inappropriate language or insult someone, that book needs to be taken off of the shelf and immediately thrown in the trash. The last thing a parent wants is their child to learn something bad from a book and repeat it at school, because that will only lead up to the child getting in serious trouble.

Parents do not want to get a phone call from the schoool principal saying their child is using inappropriate language, or being offensive to others.

There are just to many views on what is explicit to discern between what should be allowed, and what should be expunged. In many cases libraries have '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' in which books, that the majority of people would consider explicit, are held. These @CAPS2 are normally closed off and a person has to exert some sort of physical motion through a barrier in order to enter, therefore they are in full knowledge that there @MONTH1 be offensive literature there. One also must take into account the meaning of the term '@CAPS3 @CAPS4'. That term has a key phrase in the title, @CAPS3, which is almost a warning in itself that the literature in it @MONTH1 be offensive to someone. These points show that there should be no restriction on the books, magazines or music in @CAPS3 libraries. The first topic of discussion is the definition of obscene. There are @NUM1 billion people, in the @LOCATION1 alone, that all have their own views of what they consider obscene to be. If one asked an avid conservative their thoughts on obscenity, they would differ by a tremendous amount of those that a free-spirited individual would have. The inconsistency of views is an obvious reason to keep all types of books in libraries. Not only that but also the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 allows libraries to put grossly obscene literature in a hidden, but accessible area. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are made for one purpose, to sheild the general @CAPS3 of things that would be seen by the majority as obscene. These @CAPS2 are not out in the open where anyone can stumble upon them, they are usually in a corner of the @CAPS4, closed off, and marked '@CAPS1'. These @CAPS2 allow a little bit of compromise between the two sides of the debate for censorship, by still allowing all types of literature, but also sheilding anyone from seeing or hearing any of it unpurposefully. Because of these @CAPS2 there is no way anyone could complain about obscenity in the general @CAPS4 setting. For the libraries without @CAPS1 @CAPS2, there is the warning on the door of the @CAPS4, the word @CAPS3. @CAPS3 libraries are intended for the @CAPS3. Walking into one, under ones own power, dispells any complaints one would have about obscenity. This is because the act of entering a @CAPS3 @CAPS4, puts one in the atmosphere of the @CAPS4, whatever it @MONTH1 be. Libraries should not be held responsible for whether or not the literature on their shelves is offensive. The word @CAPS3 in the term @CAPS3 @CAPS4 is, like said previously, a warning of its own, letting anyone know who is entering that there is a chance there @MONTH1 be some things that person could precieve as obscene. This and multiple other reasons put to rest any thought one would have about removing certain literature from libraries. The three reasons given, along with the many more out there left unsaid, make it inevitable that libraries are not ment to be censored. The fact that the word obscene can not be tailored to fit everyone's personal views, the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and the word @CAPS3 placed infront of @CAPS4, warning everyone any type of literature could be in said @CAPS4, are enough to disspell any thought of censoring libraries.

Absolutely, there are many books, magazines, and music selections that should have never reached the shelf. Life has many choices. The people of this world have a choice on what they read or listen to. At a young age we are taught right from wrong. Everyone has different rights and many different wrongs, that they are taught by their parents. It is those morals we our taught that help us decide what we should listen to or what we shoud read. I am a high school student that is very aware of right or wrong. Though my choices @MONTH1 not show as much. I am very aware of what I read and put into my head. Who wants to have certain magazine sex stories in their head? Not me, thats for sure! That makes any guy a perverse guy. I don't read books the tell me how to get in a girl's pants, that is wrong and I belive that should be censored. As a high school guy looking at a girl can be tough on some and then deciding to read about how to get a girl only encourages those types of attitudes. It is the exact same for girls too. Reading wrong stuff puts it into your head. What goes in your head comes out. Music is very influential in todays world. Rap for instence talks about money, sex, and drugs. Like I said garbage in is garbage out. Rap does have a good side too, all music does it is just an example. Then you have rockstars that do the exact same thing. All music depending on the genre you listen to, does say a lot about the person he/ or she is. Christen music does not need to be censored, because it is positive and up-lifting. Not all songs on the radio need to be censored either. Yes the ones talking about sex, drugs, and other terrible things need to be censored. Why would you want to put that stuff in your head? It makes no sense if that is who you want to be, a unintellegent person that no one likes, due to your moods. Movies could do without all the vulgar language and the sex scenes. Movies are meant to be enjoyed. Movies recently have not been family oriented. Transformers for example is a go out with your friends movie. The @CAPS1 series should never have been created. The person that made the @CAPS1 series has a very dark and twisted mind. Scary movies have a purpose for @CAPS3 and other festivities. Scary or not it should have less sex scenes. You should not have to worry what your child is going to see if he/ or she goes out to the movies with friends. Movies play a big part in our economy and that means many adults, teenagers, and children our watching something that is or is not good for their mind and well-being, but movies still have positive impact, jsut depends on what your watching. It is very obvious that our society has different views on, if things should be censored or not. People have their own lifes to lead and live, it is their right to decide what is right and what is wrong. Books, music, and movies influence our society in many ways. Yes some things need to be censored, because music and movies are making some things socially acceptable. When growing up not all things are socially acceptable, or so we are taught. Schools should not censor many books or our music selections, because it is high school it is when we discover ourselves. It is the morals that we are taught that define us, and what we learn from those morals of what is right or wrong to; read, listen to, or watch, that is what builds us as people to grow.

The debate was due to the fact that there is a rape scene in the book, which many people find too innappropriate for freshman to be reading about. However, it seems to me that we are exposed to offensive things every day and it is not plausible to simply censor every innappropriate thing we come across. In terms of censorship in libraries, it is outlandish to think that we could do the same thing. When people visit libraries, they are there to check out books that they want to read. While there @MONTH1 be many forms of offensive media avaliable to the public through the library, that doesn't mean that people are obligated to view them. We are all perfectly capable of choosing for ourselves what we put into our minds. Because the media advertises offensive things all the time, we cannot block out everything. However we can chose what it is that we want to read when we visit the library. Since it is a choice, it shouldn't be necessary to censor everything there because you don't have to chose to view it. Censorship is also very subjective. What is deemed offensive to someone, @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else. If we oblige to sensor everything anyone claims to be offensive, there would no longer be any forms of media left. This is much like the quote from Katherine Paterson, where she says, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We rid the libraries of what each person finds offensive and what do you have left? Being around things we find offensive is, sadly, a part of life. That does not mean that we have engage in such things. It will never get to a point where everyone is completely happy with the way things are being censored unless everything is done away with, and that would only bring about new issues. We have to have the self control to provide censorship for ourselves, we cannot leave that job to other people. censorship\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 145:\n","Essay Text: I believe, an artist has the rights to his/her music being sold.

Cause if you don't want your child to listen,read,watch. Then take a big boy/girl pill and take charge. You can whin and pull a fit all you want. But, really what good is it going to do.

But in the long run they will realize you made those choices for them is cause you cared. So personally I really don't think its the music's fault or movies,magazines,etc. I think its the way those kids are rised in their household, that impacts the choices they make. Heres an example, I saw this really awesome video game that I wanted once. But my dad said no. Cause its language and themes were bad. At first I thought I hated my dad. But now I'm glad I didn't buy it. Cause what good would a video game do in the long run. Will it pay bills? No it won't. Will it bring food to the table? No it won't. Will it help you get married? No I think not. The point is the choices made now is what is going to effect you in the long run. I really think its choice. If you make the choice of buying a movie or book,music etc.With that kind of offensive behavior. Then, thats how your representing youself to others around you.

People that are offended by things always have other places to go to find books and movies and things like that. Not everybody has money to spend on movies. The library is a great place to barrow free movies and books and magazines if you cant afford to buy any. My family didnt have mony to buy any movies so we would go straight to the library to get free ones. Movies now days are very expinsive to jus be buying all the time. In the long run those movie cost are going to add up. Removing everything offensive would really limit the good choices in the library. If you are just left with all the boaring material nobody will come but the ones who got offended. People want the good stuff thats why majority of the folks go. I useally go for the music, books, and movies, but i would just leave if i saw they took all the good choices away. I left the library once because they took away my favorite book, 'A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. I loved that book and they told me they no longer have @CAPS3. I really had no other reason to go other then the music. Then they took all the hip hop away and i just never went any more.

Having material that is offensive to people in libraries is just plain wrong. The reason I believe that libraries should remove offensive material because, I always see books and movies that are racist toward @CAPS1. Like these qoutes '@CAPS1 are fat and lazy people.''@CAPS1 are border jumpers.''All @CAPS1 are good is farming and cleaning.' @CAPS5 on now, not all @CAPS1 are fat. Some of us have jobs and are tired from working long hours. We are not border jumpers. We have our passports/ green cards.All of these things are offensive and should be removed. I know other @CAPS1 get offended when they see this stuff. Let's say that you're @CAPS8 and you walk into the libray and you see a book all about jokes. You pick up the book and start looking through it and you @CAPS5 across a section about your race. The joke says 'All @CAPS9 are hillbillies.' '@CAPS10, how many @CAPS9 does it take to clean up the house? None because they're dirty so way does it matter.' I know then you would want the library to remove that book. All I'm saying is that having offensive material in the libraries is wrong. They should remove those books, music, movies, and magazines when people complain about them. You wouldn't want your children asking you questions like 'Are we dirty @CAPS9 @CAPS13?' or ' @CAPS14 are we wetbacks?'

Absolutely! I believe we should, at least for the children. There are some pretty bad things out there that I do not believe are quite appropriate for children, or even teenagers. If I were a parent, there are many things I would not let my child read or look at. If we don't even give them a chance to see them, then we wouldn't have to worry. Chidren these day are not what they used to be. What would their great grandparents think if they saw the way today's adolescents act, dress, and even talk? Where do you think they get this from? The answer is simple. They get it from today's movies, books, music, and magazines. We cannot keep going on like this or eventually we will have toddlers acting inappropriately! I know from experience that when children are small and they see or hear something, it sticks with them for a long time. If child is looking through a magazine and they see a questionable picture, they are not likely to forget that picture very soon. Or if they are listening to a song with bad words, don't be surprised if they do not forget them or even start repeating them. That is just how small children are. My last point is the fact that parents would probably be much happier if offensive material was removed from libraries. Parents would be able to bring their children to the library and not have to worry about what they are looking at or listening to. The children would feel a sense of freedom and the parents would, in return, feel a sense of reassurance. Offensive material should definitely be removed from our libraries in order to keep our children pure and their parents happy. I understand that others would argue that if we take out offensive material then eventually, there would be nothing left for our children to read. Well, obviously not everything can be censored, but I think a lot of it should be. Censoring material in libraries is definitely the way to go, not just for our children, but also our teenagers censorship\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 151:\n","Essay Text: Libraries @CAPS1 we would do without books?

I do not believe books that some people find offensive should not be taken of shelfs, because they @MONTH1 not be offensive to other people. Books should be seperated by reading levels in libraries. Having a kid, teen and adult section, will help organize a library. This will make it much easier for children to find books that they can actually read. Also if children books are seperated of adult books parents wont find any book offencive to their children. Having books organized by reading levels will make life much easier for a person looking for a certin reading level. Music should be put in to certin catorgies such as rock, jazz, rap or country. Childrens music should be in the kids section along with the books, magazines and movies. Doing this for the children will keep them away from unappriate music, books, maganzies and movies. The music section should not have any bad language in the music that they allow to be checked out. If anyone considered any of the music in the library offensive the library should remove it. Movies should also be seprated by age levels. G, @CAPS2, @NUM1, and @CAPS3 should be the catorgies that the movies should be put into. The only exception should be the childrens movies which should be put into the children section. No one should be allowed to check out a book unless the are old enough for the catorgie they are checking out. This is my view on how libraries should be set up.

I know this might be alot of work but it is needed, so kids aren't aloud to go in ths section. This will help ruduce what little kids see. There are also books and magizines that are offensive to children of a different race. These books should be removed from the shelves also because they hert peoples feelings, and this might make customers leave your libary. I am not saying ouhae to take ever single book of your selves, but a least reduce the number of books of your selves out of kids eyes mostly and some adults if they are offended. Next thing that comes to mind is the music on compacked discs, or cd's which ever you perfere. In this day and age there are alot of musicians out there that have alot of bad words in their songs. These songs; are songs parents dont like there children to listen to, because parents are afraid of their children here these words and repeating them at home. These type of cd's should be taken of shelves where kids are, and put in a section also labled adults only. I know this wont stop kids from hearing these words and say them, but at least the parents can blame you for their child saying these words, because you did the smart thing and put these cd's out of kids reach.

There are movies out there that are to graphic, to vilent, and to much nudity that kids dont need to see. These type of movies need to also get a section that is for adults only.

A lot of the public @MONTH1 like those books and other media sources that's being taken away, @CAPS1 some @MONTH1 find the books offensive, but that dosen't mean that they have to get rid of the book, when they can just put the book down. I do beleive that everyone should have a say in their public libraries to improve them, not disprove them. @PERSON1 children should be restricted from the sections that are not appropriate for their age and should be rederected to locations of sections that are appropriate for their age. Censorship on this subject means sealing other ideas off and away from the public eyes. Some of those ideas can educate people very well with quality knowledge or not, but are brain candy and just are fun to read. If people like Paterson are concerned about what @PERSON1 readers can read and uptain, they should be monitering what their children are reading and allow them or not, not the libraries. The libraries just carry the book. Books that are offensive @MONTH1 show the reader new and interesting ideas. Some for example like 'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1' show what life was like in that time. And even if the book has offensive language for @PERSON1 children means that it should be correctly cattegorized the\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 159:\n","Essay Text: A huge issue came to my attention today as I went to the library. I went to the computers to see if my favorite book available. The computer showed that the book was taken off the shelf for offending readers. I checked another list that listed numerous books, music, movies, and magazines that were also taken off of the shelves. Half of the list, I had checked out already. The librarian said the council is voting to take or not take specific books, music, movies, and other items off of the shelves for offensive content. As a regular library customer, I felt I needed to express my opinion of the topic. I believe that before these materials are taken off of the shelves that the librarians need to consider an age limit, a 'three strikes your out' rule, or how much these materials mean to people. Offending people is not what these materials are meant to do. Some books can be perceived in that way which makes the readers angry. I can understand someone's feelings being hurt by a certain topic of reading, but that person @MONTH1 not be mature enough to comprehend what the book is intending as a message. My sister who is the age of ten has read a book which offended her, but she also didn't know what the book really was about. I believe that anyone the age of sixteen or older should be allowed access to these books, music, movies, and magazines. Age sixteeen is when most people are already in high school and more mature. Anyone younger than that shouldn't be allowed access to these items. If the readers are mature enough to handle the material, then people @MONTH1 not be offended as much. Another new rule the library could try is the 'three strikes you're out rule.' @CAPS1 rule is when someone behaves inappropriately. Some people who behave inappropriately will tell everyone the book is offensive and make up stories about the book so their friends will laugh. Each person receives a strike every time they behave inappropriately. @CAPS1 includes in a school classroom as well as the library. After a certain amount of strikes, that person wouldn't be allowed to check out the material. The librarians could keep a record of @CAPS1 which could be accessed whenever. Even if the person is of age to check out the material, they couldn't do so if they had a certain amount of strikes on their record. These materials mean a great deal to people. I am an avid reader as well as movie watcher. When I read a book, I feel like I have freedom. No one is telling me I perceive the book wrong, or that isn't what the character would look like. Reading a book is my own imagination making up the pictures of the story in my head. Taking these items off of the shelves takes away people's immagination. It also takes away from the writers freedom of speech in the @CAPS2 of @CAPS3. The writers wrote their book under that @CAPS2 and now there freedom is basically being taken away from them by taking there speech off of shelves. Overall, I believe that these materials shouldn't be taken off of the shelves. The librarians should consider either making up new rules or thinking about people's opinions of the subject. The librarians should also consider the freedom of speech rule when they are taking these materials off of the shelves. If they don't consider any of these options, then all offensive materials would be taken away. One person could say a book or movie is offensive and it would be taken off of the shelf. After awhile, the library would eventually become empty. What would be left to check out? the\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 160:\n","Essay Text: Have you ever went to the library and picked up a book that you thought was good?

I do not believe that certain books should be taken off the shelf just for the kind of material that it is.If other people don't like the material in the book then they don't have to read it.Some people learn things from lessons that are learned the hard way.So maybe if they didn't like the book because of the way it was written,they should read it anyways.Offensive books can teach people lessons about how other things in the world are. Not everything that people read is going to be nice.Just like everything in the world isn't nice but we deal with it anyways.There's always going to be a really offensive person in the word,but you can't just take them off the shelve becuase that person is mean or you don't like what he's saying.If we killed every offensive person in the world, there would be barely any people left.

So my answer is no, no books, music, movies, magazines should be banned from the library because one person, or mabye the majority of people find it offensive. There is no reason to tarnish anyone elses reading, listening, or watching anything of their interest because others find it offensive. The solution that could solve all this, is for the people that find them offensive, can just completely ignore that material.I can understand by my own experiences how people can find such materials a problem though. For an example, I've read books, listened to music, watched movies, even read magazines that were offensive too me. The biggest problem that occurs in those materials to make them offensive, is usually racism. Most people can deal with it though, so if they can you should be able to, right? As I have stated before, just because you don't like it does not mean that you should disapprove of it. If you disapprove of it and get the material removed from the library then the others who liked it, won't be able to read, listen, nor watch it.The statement I'm making here, is me pretty much saying that onless you only care about yourself, then sure report about it.If you are not a person that only cares of yourself, then you would let the book stay even though you don't like it, because others @MONTH1 like it. My observations of this sort of thing is I've seen people complain how they've read this book, and it was racist towards their well-being. From my own personal readings I've understood that many people have a lot of pride for themselves of who they are and what they are. People need to understand though, it was written by someone else.You @MONTH1 judge, but out of your own respect, should not report to remove of something for their ideas. the\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 162:\n","Essay Text: Here is what I think about materials being removed from the shelves if they are offensive. I think that some people have different things they like to read and listen to. Someone might like a certain type of book, and another might think it's offensive. So what do you do about this situation? Yes, there might be some books that could be offensive to people if they are about certain things. What if a little kid is in the adult area looking at books and they find a book they shouldn't have seen? Well most parents would want those books to be removed from the library. There could also be books that are just offensive to adults because of what they are about. I've seen people at my library get offended by something they read and they didn't want it back on the shelf. What if there are some @CAPS1's that a little kid checks out and it has language in the music? I don't think that any of that music should be in the library at all. Especially with little kids roaming the library. The music in the library could be offensive to other people to. Not just young kids. When you walk into a library usually the first thing you see are magazines. There can be some pretty inapropriate magazines with inapropriate covers. Is this really what you want people looking at? Especially young kids? There are also movies at a library. Yes, most of them are old movies, but some of them are also kids movies. What if one of those old movies had a bad cover on it, or bad language? A lot of movies are also offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3. I think this because, back in the old days there was a lot of racism, and that is still in alot of movies now. There could also be movies against someones religion. That could be very offensive to certain people. Most of this stuff in libraries can be offensive to young kids because of the covers. Some can be offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because of racism. I think that if you have a problem with something that you see on a shelf, you should tell the librarian and see if they will take it off the shelf. You shouldn't have to be offended by something at the library. I think that people should have their rights to get certain materials off of the shelf. Especially if they think it's offensive to them, or anybody else that might happen to see the same thing. Is this really what we want in our libraries is offensive materials?

And why somethings do not need to be sensored at the library. I will help you to understand what young teenagers or younger children should and should not be able to see or borrow from the library. There are somethings that should be kept from the kids eyes. What are some of the movies, books, or magazines that should be hidden from children? This is probably what you are woundering. The first thing that kids should not be allowed to borrow would be movies that have any that is over there age requirement to see at the movie theather. The reason this is so that the teenager or young child does not watch anything that @MONTH1 scary them. Another thing that should not be seen would be the movies that are meant for a mature veiwer meaning an adult viewer. There are a few books that kids should not be able to read until they are an adult. And these books would be the ones that have a harsh backround on past events that happened. Like what happen during a war to a captured soldier or a prisoner of war. And what they to go through during their imprisonment. These are the books that should be hidden from younger childern. There are some movies, books, music, magazines that do not need to be sensored for people to see. Starting with why some movie do not need to be sensored. First is because most movies are funny but have just a little need of maturity. These movies are the ones that have alot of comedy and as most adults know most kids are into the funny movies. So why take away a movie that is something a kid would have a great time watching. There are some books that should probably be read by adults but there are some teenagers that are mature enough to read this stories. Or if they need to learn about a specific topic for school work they should be allowed to read that book. I do not think that any genre or group of music should be sensored. This because music is a way for someone to express themselves without even having to truely say anything. about who they are or what kind of a mood they are in. music does much more then just that though it helps some people vent on there anger or even how sad they @MONTH1 be. But in conclusion I think there are many things that are good but still need to be sensored for most of the young childern and teenagers to be able to see.

I believe they should allow these certain category of books, movies, and magazines to be allowed, however to an extent. Libraries should open up an area for people above the age of @NUM1 to view this material with a special membership. Books and magazines in libraries are, and should be seperated by categories. The books and magazines that could be considered 'highly offensive,' do not belong on the library shelves at all. However, books and magazines that give out informative data with proper conduct should be allowed. If libraries create an area in which peoples' prefrences are to view content over the age of @NUM1, they should be required to have their own membership. In order to even look at material that is uncensored, visitors need a special pass; this way people who get offended by material that is not censored do not have to pass it while inside the library. Many people who do not want to go out and spend @MONEY1 on a movie rental like to go to the library. Libraries should allow movies from the ranges of ratings @CAPS1(@CAPS2) to @CAPS3(@CAPS4) to be on the shelves of the library. Going into a public library should not have any more restrictions that going into a public video store. However, videos that are considered 'pornography,' should not be in any part of the library. Just like in a public video store, libraries should not contain any footage that is considered pornography. Much of the popular music today is considered offensive. The music in libraries can still be the same songs, but they need to have clean content in them. I believe that edited music in libraries is okay under any circumstances. I do not believe that explicit music is okay. People inside the library could be listening to this explicit music before they take it home, while others in the library get offended by it. People overhearing music would not happen often, but we need to make sure it does not happen at all.

I disagree with removing certain material from the library and here is why. First, the reason why i would'nt remove certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc., because the library is a place where people come to learn about new things. Just because one person does'nt like the book does'nt make it right for them to remove it. If people don't wont their children to read the book don't let them go to the library. They go buy their child some good books to read. Also, no one would want to go to a library that does'nt have what they are looking for. That would'nt be a good look for the library, because if someone goes there and find that all the books their looking for is not in and this is the only library in town they would never want to go back there again. Then they would tell moe people about how that library does'nt have anything your looking for in it. Then, the library would get old close down then get knocked down, and in the shot were the library use to be would be a mini mall, food store, ect. so i really don't think it's a good idea to take book off the shelves at the libraries.

They talked about how they feel, where you can get them from, and what they looked like. For a minor reading on how to get drugs and use them, that's telling them to much. It is not a good thing to tell kid's so early in their life about drugs because, they are going to get curious about how the drugs feel. When I was told about drugs I was very curious and I wanted to learn more about them. The older and boring we become the more we will want to try the drugs we learned about earlier in our lives. More people every day try drugs because there is nothing else to do. When I learned about sex while being a kid made me want to try it because they made it sound good in books. Being teached offensive things in libraries is a bad thing because, who would think something bad could be in a library?

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exaclty the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' -@ORGANIZATION1 quote moves mountians with its wisdom. In @ORGANIZATION1 day and age, many of the things we read/see in magazines, movies, the news etc. are considered to be quite offensive to many. Would a mother of a fifteen year old be upset if @CAPS5 found her daughter reading a magazine that stated, 'safe sex is great sex', or a father finding his teenage son watching a movie with pornographic scenes? The answer is no. The magazines, movies, music and books that are being sent out into libraries all over the world are not exactly '@CAPS1 rated' and many adults would be shocked to realize exactly what it is teenagers are viewing; but is it right to then remove everything some one finds to be wrong or offensive? Lets think about religion for a second. Atheists would find the bible to be a lie, maybe even find it offensive. So in turn to be considerate of their beliefs does that make it 'right' to remove the bible from libraries and open access to the public? Think about the novel, 'To @CAPS2 a @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. English scholars around the world will state that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a novel of its time; that it will continue to be read hundreds of years from now at schools around the world. Some though, would find @ORGANIZATION1 book offensive. The word 'nigger' is placed in @ORGANIZATION1 novel many times and is set in a time when slavery is not frowned apon. Just because one parent finds @ORGANIZATION1 book to be offensive does that mean students from all over should no longer be allowed to read it; that @ORGANIZATION1 book should be 'removed from the shelves?' The questions posed here are not simple questions, they require much time and thought. If a survey was posted asking: Should certain materials be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? The outcome would be intangible to think about now, considering people have many different views on the aspect. In reading @ORGANIZATION1 and contemplating the questions asked you will realize that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a black or white concept; there lies a large area of grey in the middle. Something that one @MONTH1 find offensive, another would not; something a teenager views as interesting an adult @MONTH1 view as crude or vulger. Does @ORGANIZATION1 mean that everything would be taken down from the shelves then? Yes. In the quote above by Katherine Paterson, @CAPS5 states, '.. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS5 is correct in @ORGANIZATION1 because @CAPS5 realizes that everyone has different views on what is appropriate or not. @ORGANIZATION1 statement shows that although libraries @MONTH1 allow inappropriate novels, magazines, tapes etc. to be open to the easy access of customers there is no way that they would be able to make everyone feel content without completely wiping out the building of its contents. The right to take a book away also is a right to leave it; leave the books then and let the ones who enjoy them, simply enjoy. the\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 176:\n","Essay Text: We have all read a book or heard a song that has offended us or just didn't catch our intrest, right?

I'll begin by asking; what is censorship? Think about that question while you're reading, or stop and think a moment before you continue. I hope what I have to say will give you a clear idea or a new perspective, and that you might understand what I think the importance of censorship in libraries really means, and not just to me, but to all who pick up a book. To answer my previous question, censoring is the removing of suggestive or otherwise offensive materials from any or all sources of information, or entertainment. Now I'll ask another question; why do we have censorship? Most believe that all children have a right to know things they'll learn about eventually whether or not they want to, and therefore don't care when their children are exposed to that knowledge. Those people don't consider the consequences of that knowledge in the wrong hands, or wrong minds. Children don't think on the same track that most adults do, and therefore are incapable of handling certain knowledges that adults have long since known and otherwise dealt with. Those who know of the consequences of certain knowledges in the wrong minds have tried to keep the information from those who can't or shouldn't worry about them untill they're older and more capable of understanding what it all means. A lot of ideas we have @DATE1, from science and technology, from philosophical thinking to common sense, most everything has been written down in the past, or is being written @DATE1. That's where the problems arise. Almost everything is written about or recorded in some way, therefore increasing the chances that someone will hear or see this knowledge and, not knowing it's importance, might even abuse it eventually. Think about the crimes that go on @DATE1. Are all of them simple? Do they all focus on the same things? How do they come about? All these questions are able to be answered in the simplest ways; the people who commited them learned about something too early in life and grew up thinking it was ok, whether they learned it from books, or music, or movies, etc., and eventually repeated these things they learned. Of course that's not always the case, but for those people who don't know why so many people ended up as the people who get thrown into jail, or get into trouble, a major factor is what they learn at an early age, and not having sensible people to help them to know what's right and what's wrong. To conclude, I think the best ways to avoid the wrong information getting into the wrong hands, is to have censorship in libraries. Without it, people can just walk up to any shelf and pick up that one book, even a nine-year-old child. the\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 180:\n","Essay Text: Some books, music, movies, and magazines or other types of information or entertanment are innapropriate. I dont believe that they should be removed from the library or other puplic places for that reason though. You have to take a lot into conciteration before decideing weather it should be censored or not. Age is one aspect. If the material is not sutable to a sertain age then it should be organized into a different age category according to the library. I believe that there should be age limits like the ones they have on movies or video games. Rescently there was a book, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, that was questioned on the use of language in it. I think that the author wrote their book the way they want it and would like it sold that way not have it censored. If you find something offensive that doesen't mean you should keep getting involved with it. If there is a book or movie that is offfensive to you, you can stop reading or stop watching it at your own will. Often on the radio there are songs that use innapropriate language and it is bleeped out. Why should we bleep it? Some people could find it more offensive to hear it bleeped than to hear the words just said. And thier oppinion should be the one that counts. The questin weather there should be censorship in libraries is all about a persons perspecitve. Someone is always going to see it differently than you. There is nothing bad about that. I remember watching a show one time and there were these characters in a book club and they were debateing the book its self. Not always is everyone going to like your oppinion of something but you shouldn't despise people for that. I believe that the libraries should not have to use censorship when we have lived as humans long enough to be able to make a decision for ourselves. We should stop being told what to do by rules and laws all the time and have our oppinions heard. the\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 181:\n","Essay Text: I believe that our libraries should stay the same as they have always been.

I never even heard of a problem in the libraries about things offending people before but sometimes people just need to grow up. There's a certain point to where yeah things should not be writen or films that should'nt have been made but if you dont like it, then dont read it and or watch it. People all have a right to the libraries. Nobody forces anyone to read or watch something, its by the readers choice. Theres no sence in ruining many peoples enjoyment just because a selected few people dont like something. Thats like the @ORGANIZATION2 not having any football just because the players feel like they dont get payed enough @MONEY1 to play it. Taking books and magazines off the library shelves is like the @ORGANIZATION2 locking out everything. Just because a few people arent happy, doesnt mean that everything should be taking out so others cant enjoy it. Why even have a library if your going to change everything because people get offended. Is @ORGANIZATION1 going to stop carrying penuts because some people are allergic to them? No. If people dont like something they have the choice to buy or take it if they want to or not. Its a simple fact that some things should just be left alone. People are all different. Its going to take a long time for people to figure that out. In fact, people @MONTH1 never figure that out. So in my opionion I believe that the libraries can carry anything they want as long as it is appropreit. My thinking is that it will be best if we keep libraries the way they are.

Imagine a little girl about the age of four walking through differnce sections of books in a library when she finds a book that cacthes her eye in the adult section. The book is baby blue and has a little bird on it. However, the book also has a half naked man on cover besided the cute little bird. The girl grabs the book and goes happly to find her mom. When the mom looks at the book her face is in shock. What would you do if that was your daughter? Most likely we'd put the book back and explain why she can't have it. While, others would go screaming to the check out and asking, 'how is it possible that my daughter got this? Shouldn't the libraries be wacthing the kids to make sure they don't go in that section?'. I believe that certain materials, such as books,movies, ect., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact people will still find way to get the removed material and that it's just a part of life. My first reason that certain materials, such as books, shouldn't be pulled from are shelves is that we live in a nation that prides it's self as the '@CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. That doesn't mean we get everything for @CAPS2 when we go to a store it just simple means that you, the people of @LOCATION1, have the freedom and right to speak your mind. So you can say whatever you want in newspapers or in books because the government gives you that right. However, you can't say 'I have a bomb' at the airports because of the many attacks the nation has encountered over the years, but that's common sences. My second reason that certain materials should say on the put, even if someone is offened by it is that no matter how many books or movies you take of the store shelves, the people will find a way to get them. One way to get them is the black market where people sell drugs and weapons. Do we, as a country really need another drug on the market even if it's a book? I think not. Also, if you look at the whole picture people will be losing jobs because the televison today is not the kind they had back in your grandma's day. Nearly @PERCENT1 of everything on televison has something to do with the little three letter s-word every parent hates to talk about. You might be thinking that if we take the unrated movies and the books with the naked men on the cover we'd be saving are children which leads me to my last point. Seeing unrated movies and such is a part of life. So what are you saving them from? Children sooner or later will grow up and learn about the types of subject matter so why take it off when you will have to teach them about it sooner rather then later? Millions of parents around the @CAPS3 each and every year have to teach their kids about the birds and the bees. It's a part of growing up in a way. Now a days though, the birds and the bees are all people seem to talk about. So like it or not your kids will find out just like you did and your parents before you. Plus, your not going to make everyone happy. Someone will always be offened by something. Imagine. Imagine that same little girl, now an adult, having to deal with that same issue of the same baby blue book with the same little bird with the half naked man on the cover. The truth is that this way my mother when she was little and it turns out that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree because I had the same issue as well. I know that one day I will also have the same issue as my mother did before me. So I believe that certain materials, such as books and movies, shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact that people will still find a way to get the removed material and that it's just apart of life.

The media should be for everyone to enjoy and not have to worry about offensive material. In @DATE1's world there are offensive media out there and they often start up problems. We need to do something about this problem. If there are offensive media out there the kids of the future are going to look up to them and try to be like them or hate the same thing that the media does. Let's just say there was a song about school and how people dont like it don't you think our kids are going to hate school too? I don't think that is right. We need to teach our kids that school is very important and not to take in what the media says because they are not always right. We want enjoyable media in the world.

I'm sure libraries all around the world have some kind of offensive media in it. We need to stand up and fight to get rid of all offensive media and make the world a better place.

Truth be told, there are many ways for our offspring to not have the availability of those books. There is what I believe to be an appropriate division on the materials in our libraries and bookstores, the fact that we can always monitor what our children read and watch, and not to mention that we can use the internet to back up any doubts we have on the literature and lyrics.The question that remains is: Are we using the ways of preventing this problem to the best of our abilities? I believe that our public libraries and bookstores do a splendid job of diviying up what is deemed appropriate for each age group. Teens know a fairly good amount more about things than all parents invision they shouldn't, and I think the bookstores and libraries keep the youths knowledge in what they're listening, watching, and reading to what these kids already know. Comparing what is considered a 'young adult' book and an 'adult' book, you will find an atrocious difference. Young adult books only hint around things such as drugs, refraining from abstinence, and grisly murder scenes whereas adult books go into a great deal more detail. Middle school level children's books are even more less detailed than teen books, so it is save to say that as long as the parents are directing their child into the appropriate section in anyone's given local library, they will be in good hands. There's also the option of monitering what our young ones are listening to. By simply being interested in what it is that the child is singing or humming along to, us parents would find that they wouldn't be reluctant to let on about what was being said. If in any case we feel that the lyrics are too harsh for the kid, we are still their parents and have the right to deem it as something they shouldn't be listening to and suggest something different to them and/or ban them from being able to listen. In @CAPS1 cases though, we should try to listen to what our kids are. In this way, we can be reassured that the range of materials they're plugging into their ears are not what we would consider to be grotesque for something our children's age. Another useful tool would have to be the internet. If we don't feel the need to ask about the literature or music, but @MONTH1 still have a few doubts, there are plenty of book and music blogs across the world wide web that can help us out. Even by going to a bookstore website and reading the description about the book, or a lyric website that will tell us what is being said, or even a movie website where we can see a rating and the content of the movie, and the comments left by people that go with it respectively, @CAPS1 of us would find all of the information we need. Even author's, director's, and artist's websites would be useful. Looking at their discussions would be a big help as well, considering that @CAPS1 of these people have a vision of what age groups would be attracted to their material. In conclusion, I think our children are fairly wise about what they choose to read, listen to, and watch, but then again, it all depends on the preference. Not every child is the same, just as not any adult, or any one person. The prefernce tends to lean towards the things we think are appropriate. Paying attention to what the young ones are like says alot about what they read, and what they listen to and watch, for that matter. We have all these ways of keeping our children from reading, watching and listening to inappropriate things, we just have to make them and asset the\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 186:\n","Essay Text: For many years libraries have had books, magazines, and movies posted in their shelves of the library that are very offensive to many people. Many people ask how is it ok for that material to be open to teenagers and possibly children. In my opinion I think that it is not right for libraries not to do anything about this problem, especially when this is happening across the nation. In large department stores such as @ORGANIZATION1, you are required to be eighteen years old to purchase adult items, sometimes you must be twenty-one years of age. It is considered illegal for anyone under the required age to purchase an item with an age limit on it. Music is a totally different type of profanity, @CAPS1 albums are sold with much innapropiate material in them that is open to the public, but the @CAPS1's sold in stores are usually edited into a more appropiate version. Days like today nearly no one ever buys @CAPS1's anymore, its all about @CAPS4's and @NUM1's where all you have to do is find your song on a site and download it for free in about four to five seconds. It would not surprise me if libraries had music and @CAPS1's with just as much adult profanity, and language that is not edited out. So if most of the things in this world that are adult rated and can not be purchased unless your considered an adult by age, why should it be ok to viewed by any age in a library. I myself believe that it should be illegal for materials such as the ones mentioned to be banned or atleast taken more respected with the viewer of the materials. It would really hurt a parent for them to take a kid to a library and tell them to go find a book they like, and they return to their mother or father with an adult book with many things a child or possibly a teenager should not see. I believe times like those could tear a parent or even a grandparent apart, having to explain to their children or grandchildren what they just saw. Because most of us know that most children always want to know what something is when they see it, and for a parent to have to explain to their child at that age has to be heart-stopping. In all of this that I have explained is only my opinion, but I believe many other millions of people agree with me. If it is not aloud almost everywhere else in this world, why should it be ok a library to do it? Is it because its some little rule about freedom of decision? Do libraries think just because they are old fashioned and have been here longer than the @CAPS1's, @CAPS4's, and @NUM1's that they dont have to follow rules and guidelines. It is a shame that they are ruining the lives and visions of the children and teens today to think its ok for anyone to see, listen, or watch these materials. the\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 187:\n","Essay Text: There are many books in the libraries.

There are also book that are on bullying. These should be removed because children can read them and start bullying other children. Also they can b threatening to children that are being bullyed.

Magazines show and tell things that celebrities are doing. Not only will young children do these things but young adults. Magazines also show people criticizing politics. Some @MONTH1 include talking bad about the @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @CAPS1. Young adults @MONTH1 take this the wrong way and start doing the same thing. This @MONTH1 also make it seem like they are bad people. Also, they use verbal abuse and use bad lauguages. Some books, movies, and magazines should be removed if they are offensive to people. Young children and young adults are the most effected by this. They are effected because they see what adults are doing and want to do the same thing. Especially people that they think are role models. All books that are offensive should be removed. the\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 188:\n","Essay Text: Reflecting newspaper views on censorship in libraries. I say no that the books, music, movies, or magazines should not be removed from libraries, because if the books or etc. are that offensive, those things shouldn't be in childrens reach anyway. There should be a section limit where children can't go by to get to the offensive type books and others. Why take things that older people would insist on looking at off the shelf just because someone didn't separate the adult books and etc., from the childrens. Taking away the things that adults look at would be just as bad as taking the things that children or teens would like such as the music and movies, even though the music sometimes influnce some children to do bad or get off track from being who they really are. I don't understand why take those type things down when you are getting benefits off the things that people buy that will help keep libraries open such as fun rasier type. If you don't have things in a library that will capture a young persons attention like the movies, music, or magazines then children or teens will not be interested on going to libraries. Adults nor teens will sit in a library with under age books, movies, or music. Reason being is, becuase they are muture and not exactly looking for a book with lots of pictures and cartoons unless they are reading to an under age sibling. When that child has to go to library with his or her parent for example to do a project that parent would rather not just sit and wait the whole time for his or her child to finish. That is where the magazines come in ; magazines are very interesting books such as @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS2 @CAPS3 those magazines occupy peoples time while they are waiting just like any other places. Everywhere you go children are going to see things that they shouldn't see at their age, because television and the internet has so many componets that will cause a distraction to a childs mind that will make them question everything they see. That child will soon have to learn. That is how most children are becoming so blunt with the things they do or say, because either they seen it or heard it. I know you @MONTH1 think that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves to keep out of reach of children, but I think that if you are able to separate all upper age group books, movies, music, magazines from all children and other young adults, the library would become more beneficial to everyone that has access to a local library. the\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 189:\n","Essay Text: I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Materials should not be offensive in any way to chilren, or any human being. Now, I will tell the many readers that will read this article what I think should be and what should not be on the shelf. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories, should teach lessons, and should not be offensive. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories. When I sit down to read a book or magazine, or to watch a movie, I want to read or watch an interesting story. A little child is not going to want to read a book about history or science, they will want to read about @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @LOCATION2, or @ORGANIZATION1. Children will not sit still unless they have something to read or watch that is interesting and appealing to them. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should teach lessons. I believe that libraries should have books, magazines, etc., that teach them how to tie their shoes, to count, or to say the alphabet. Children love to sing, so simply put a @CAPS3 in that sings the alphabet, and the child will be singing along shortly. When a child pulls a book off of the shelf at a library, that shows a pretty picture, the child will be attracted to it, and learn as they read or watch. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be offensive. Kids should not read a book, magazine, etc., if the author is talking about harming someone or something. If the book, magazine, etc., has inappropriate language or insult someone, that book needs to be taken off of the shelf and immediately thrown in the trash. The last thing a parent wants is their child to learn something bad from a book and repeat it at school, because that will only lead up to the child getting in serious trouble. Again, I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be banned from the shelves if they are found offensive. Parents do not want to get a phone call from the schoool principal saying their child is using inappropriate language, or being offensive to others. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell wonderful stories, should teach children things that will help them in school, and should not say harmful things about someone or something. Children can learn so much from books, music, movies, magazines, etc., so why make them say offensive or disrespectful things? the\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 190:\n","Essay Text: Censorship In Libraries Do you believe that certain marerials such as books, music movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if found offensive?

There are just to many views on what is explicit to discern between what should be allowed, and what should be expunged. In many cases libraries have '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' in which books, that the majority of people would consider explicit, are held. These @CAPS2 are normally closed off and a person has to exert some sort of physical motion through a barrier in order to enter, therefore they are in full knowledge that there @MONTH1 be offensive literature there. One also must take into account the meaning of the term '@CAPS3 @CAPS4'. That term has a key phrase in the title, @CAPS3, which is almost a warning in itself that the literature in it @MONTH1 be offensive to someone. These points show that there should be no restriction on the books, magazines or music in @CAPS3 libraries. The first topic of discussion is the definition of obscene. There are @NUM1 billion people, in the @LOCATION1 alone, that all have their own views of what they consider obscene to be. If one asked an avid conservative their thoughts on obscenity, they would differ by a tremendous amount of those that a free-spirited individual would have. The inconsistency of views is an obvious reason to keep all types of books in libraries. Not only that but also the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 allows libraries to put grossly obscene literature in a hidden, but accessible area. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are made for one purpose, to sheild the general @CAPS3 of things that would be seen by the majority as obscene. These @CAPS2 are not out in the open where anyone can stumble upon them, they are usually in a corner of the @CAPS4, closed off, and marked '@CAPS1'. These @CAPS2 allow a little bit of compromise between the two sides of the debate for censorship, by still allowing all types of literature, but also sheilding anyone from seeing or hearing any of it unpurposefully. Because of these @CAPS2 there is no way anyone could complain about obscenity in the general @CAPS4 setting. For the libraries without @CAPS1 @CAPS2, there is the warning on the door of the @CAPS4, the word @CAPS3. @CAPS3 libraries are intended for the @CAPS3. Walking into one, under ones own power, dispells any complaints one would have about obscenity. This is because the act of entering a @CAPS3 @CAPS4, puts one in the atmosphere of the @CAPS4, whatever it @MONTH1 be. Libraries should not be held responsible for whether or not the literature on their shelves is offensive. The word @CAPS3 in the term @CAPS3 @CAPS4 is, like said previously, a warning of its own, letting anyone know who is entering that there is a chance there @MONTH1 be some things that person could precieve as obscene. This and multiple other reasons put to rest any thought one would have about removing certain literature from libraries. The three reasons given, along with the many more out there left unsaid, make it inevitable that libraries are not ment to be censored. The fact that the word obscene can not be tailored to fit everyone's personal views, the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and the word @CAPS3 placed infront of @CAPS4, warning everyone any type of literature could be in said @CAPS4, are enough to disspell any thought of censoring libraries. Underground bunkers were designed to sheild and censor the @CAPS3, not libraries. the\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 192:\n","Essay Text: Bad @CAPS1 Should be Removed I think that they schould be taken off of the shelves in libraries.

Absolutely, there are many books, magazines, and music selections that should have never reached the shelf. Life has many choices. The people of this world have a choice on what they read or listen to. At a young age we are taught right from wrong. Everyone has different rights and many different wrongs, that they are taught by their parents. It is those morals we our taught that help us decide what we should listen to or what we shoud read. I am a high school student that is very aware of right or wrong. Though my choices @MONTH1 not show as much. I am very aware of what I read and put into my head. Who wants to have certain magazine sex stories in their head? Not me, thats for sure! That makes any guy a perverse guy. I don't read books the tell me how to get in a girl's pants, that is wrong and I belive that should be censored. As a high school guy looking at a girl can be tough on some and then deciding to read about how to get a girl only encourages those types of attitudes. It is the exact same for girls too. Reading wrong stuff puts it into your head. What goes in your head comes out. Music is very influential in todays world. Rap for instence talks about money, sex, and drugs. Like I said garbage in is garbage out. Rap does have a good side too, all music does it is just an example. Then you have rockstars that do the exact same thing. All music depending on the genre you listen to, does say a lot about the person he/ or she is. Christen music does not need to be censored, because it is positive and up-lifting. Not all songs on the radio need to be censored either. Yes the ones talking about sex, drugs, and other terrible things need to be censored. Why would you want to put that stuff in your head? It makes no sense if that is who you want to be, a unintellegent person that no one likes, due to your moods. Movies could do without all the vulgar language and the sex scenes. Movies are meant to be enjoyed. Movies recently have not been family oriented. Transformers for example is a go out with your friends movie. The @CAPS1 series should never have been created. The person that made the @CAPS1 series has a very dark and twisted mind. Scary movies have a purpose for @CAPS3 and other festivities. Scary or not it should have less sex scenes. You should not have to worry what your child is going to see if he/ or she goes out to the movies with friends. Movies play a big part in our economy and that means many adults, teenagers, and children our watching something that is or is not good for their mind and well-being, but movies still have positive impact, jsut depends on what your watching. It is very obvious that our society has different views on, if things should be censored or not. People have their own lifes to lead and live, it is their right to decide what is right and what is wrong. Books, music, and movies influence our society in many ways. Yes some things need to be censored, because music and movies are making some things socially acceptable. When growing up not all things are socially acceptable, or so we are taught. Schools should not censor many books or our music selections, because it is high school it is when we discover ourselves. It is the morals that we are taught that define us, and what we learn from those morals of what is right or wrong to; read, listen to, or watch, that is what builds us as people to grow. You put garbage in your morals with what you do, you are only going to get garbage out the\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 194:\n","Essay Text: During my freshman year there was a lot of controversy over whether or not the classes should be allowed to read 'The @ORGANIZATION1' in school. The debate was due to the fact that there is a rape scene in the book, which many people find too innappropriate for freshman to be reading about. However, it seems to me that we are exposed to offensive things every day and it is not plausible to simply censor every innappropriate thing we come across. In terms of censorship in libraries, it is outlandish to think that we could do the same thing. When people visit libraries, they are there to check out books that they want to read. While there @MONTH1 be many forms of offensive media avaliable to the public through the library, that doesn't mean that people are obligated to view them. We are all perfectly capable of choosing for ourselves what we put into our minds. Because the media advertises offensive things all the time, we cannot block out everything. However we can chose what it is that we want to read when we visit the library. Since it is a choice, it shouldn't be necessary to censor everything there because you don't have to chose to view it. Censorship is also very subjective. What is deemed offensive to someone, @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else. If we oblige to sensor everything anyone claims to be offensive, there would no longer be any forms of media left. This is much like the quote from Katherine Paterson, where she says, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We rid the libraries of what each person finds offensive and what do you have left? Being around things we find offensive is, sadly, a part of life. That does not mean that we have engage in such things. It will never get to a point where everyone is completely happy with the way things are being censored unless everything is done away with, and that would only bring about new issues. We have to have the self control to provide censorship for ourselves, we cannot leave that job to other people. the\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 195:\n","Essay Text: I believe, an artist has the rights to his/her music being sold.

Absolutely! I believe we should, at least for the children. There are some pretty bad things out there that I do not believe are quite appropriate for children, or even teenagers. If I were a parent, there are many things I would not let my child read or look at. If we don't even give them a chance to see them, then we wouldn't have to worry. Chidren these day are not what they used to be. What would their great grandparents think if they saw the way today's adolescents act, dress, and even talk? Where do you think they get this from? The answer is simple. They get it from today's movies, books, music, and magazines. We cannot keep going on like this or eventually we will have toddlers acting inappropriately! I know from experience that when children are small and they see or hear something, it sticks with them for a long time. If child is looking through a magazine and they see a questionable picture, they are not likely to forget that picture very soon. Or if they are listening to a song with bad words, don't be surprised if they do not forget them or even start repeating them. That is just how small children are. My last point is the fact that parents would probably be much happier if offensive material was removed from libraries. Parents would be able to bring their children to the library and not have to worry about what they are looking at or listening to. The children would feel a sense of freedom and the parents would, in return, feel a sense of reassurance. Offensive material should definitely be removed from our libraries in order to keep our children pure and their parents happy. I understand that others would argue that if we take out offensive material then eventually, there would be nothing left for our children to read.

We need libraries. We need books. Kids, teenagers and ect. will enentually learn the topic, either in the libraty or at home, even at school with friends; so why take our books away? I also belive that even though I don't like certain topics, they should not be removed from the libraries. I peronally agree with the author Katherine Paterson, she thought many books were offensive to the audiance, but if someone had the power to remove a book from the shelfs, that made everyone to have this power, and @CAPS1 would we have left? We would loose very important information of our lifes and our ancestors. People have different taste, fellings, thoughts. If we listen to every person's dislikes over our books in the libraries, our shelfs would be empty and eventually we wouldn't have libraries. I'm please asking you, don't remove our books of the shelfs. Don't take our past and our future. We are who we are because of the information books have thought us during the years. Books, magazines, movies and music are part of our lifes, taking them away, you are taking our lifes aswell the\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 202:\n","Essay Text: Its an @CAPS1 Have you ever been in a library and you are looking for a certin book, but just cannot seen to find it because everything is out of order? Many libraries have trouble organizing their material, in ways that will help people find what their looking for easier. I believe that books movies, magazines and music should all be separated. I do not believe books that some people find offensive should not be taken of shelfs, because they @MONTH1 not be offensive to other people. Books should be seperated by reading levels in libraries. Having a kid, teen and adult section, will help organize a library. This will make it much easier for children to find books that they can actually read. Also if children books are seperated of adult books parents wont find any book offencive to their children. Having books organized by reading levels will make life much easier for a person looking for a certin reading level. Music should be put in to certin catorgies such as rock, jazz, rap or country. Childrens music should be in the kids section along with the books, magazines and movies. Doing this for the children will keep them away from unappriate music, books, maganzies and movies. The music section should not have any bad language in the music that they allow to be checked out. If anyone considered any of the music in the library offensive the library should remove it. Movies should also be seprated by age levels. G, @CAPS2, @NUM1, and @CAPS3 should be the catorgies that the movies should be put into. The only exception should be the childrens movies which should be put into the children section. No one should be allowed to check out a book unless the are old enough for the catorgie they are checking out. This is my view on how libraries should be set up. I think by doing this it would keeps the younger children away from books that might be offensive to them. I do not think that books that some people find offensive should be taken off the shelfs, because they might not be offensive to other people the\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","#########################################################\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"xRaapT25Onm2","colab_type":"code","outputId":"60f2b479-548b-4b4d-8275-e47d0bb4f932","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1588516150502,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":96352,"user":{"displayName":"Dheeraj Kondaparthi","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhKN5cRrlPtQfVXEjCmXRheG4iIhzDBq-YXmUur=s64","userId":"09317881797538835469"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000}},"source":["print(\"#########################################################\")\n","print(\"ADVERSARIAL TESTS (INSERTION ATTACK - LIBRARY):\")\n","print(\"#########################################################\")\n","\n","sample_essay = range(502,552)\n","print_prediction(D1_cnn_model_black_box, D2_cnn_model_black_box, sample_essay)\n","\n","print(\"\\n#########################################################\")"],"execution_count":39,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["#########################################################\n","ADVERSARIAL TESTS (INSERTION ATTACK - LIBRARY):\n","#########################################################\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 503:\n","Essay Text: Do u believe there are books, music, magizines, and movies in are libaries? These meterials could consist of nude pictures and so on. Most parents do not want to see there kids getting a hold of this type of material. You maybe think 'what could we do about this things, or least come to a compermise to make almost everyone happy. I have so reasons why we should put this type of material away from kids sight and reach. First of all, the books and magizines that have any nude in them, should have their own section and, be labled aduts only. I know this might be alot of work but it is needed, so kids aren't aloud to go in ths section. This will help ruduce what little kids see. There are also books and magizines that are offensive to children of a different race. These books should be removed from the shelves also because they hert peoples feelings, and this might make customers leave your libary. I am not saying ouhae to take ever single book of your selves, but a least reduce the number of books of your selves out of kids eyes mostly and some adults if they are offended. Next thing that comes to mind is the music on compacked discs, or cd's which ever you perfere. In this day and age there are alot of musicians out there that have alot of bad words in their songs. These songs; are songs parents dont like there children to listen to, because parents are afraid of their children here these words and repeating them at home. These type of cd's should be taken of shelves where kids are, and put in a library section also labled adults only. I know this wont stop kids from hearing these words and say them, but at least the parents can blame you for their child saying these words, because you did the smart thing and put these cd's out of kids reach. There are songs that are ofensive to people but i know you cant go throught every song and take them off the shelves, but a least take the cd's off the shelve that you know are offensive to people. The last that comes to mind that should be taken off the shelves that are material children shouldnt see is the movies. There are movies out there that are to graphic, to vilent, and to much nudity that kids dont need to see. These type of movies need to also get a section that is for adults only. Then you have the movies that need to just be taking off the shelve because they are to offensive to some viewers. I know that you @MONTH1 say but if it is offensive to them, they dont have to get it. This maybe true but a least move the to a section that those people that get offended dont go. Those were my thoughts on what should be done with material thats to offensive and not aprobriet for eyes or minds.These might be a little extreme but i hope you at least take some of these things into consideration. You cant please all but you can try. Thanks for reading this and i hope it as changed your thoughts on material thats bad for kids to see\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 504:\n","Essay Text: I strongly believe that there are some materials that should not be allowed on the shevles. There are things in this world that kids should not see for a long time. If there are things that are offensive on the shelves, then kids can read it and it could lead to bad things. When you enter a library, you don't want to see something that is very offensive. For example, one time my friend and I walked in to the library and the first thing we saw was a book about inappropiate things. We were young so that was the last thing we wanted to see. It was a horrible thing to see and I feel that no child should have to see that when they go into a library. You can never unsee things. No parent wants their children going into a library and reading things they shouldn't. It @MONTH1 have an affect on their childrens behavior and future.

If I was to find something bad there I would ask them to remove it from the shelf. I believe that everyone should have the right to remove a book from the shelf if it is offensive. I also think that eveyone would need a good reason library to remove it because eventually there wouldn't be very many books left on the shelves.

How is that fair? Words in the library are just people's opinions about other people, groups, or other things. Sure there are facts about what that group or person did, but that's history. People need to know what happened in the past so they can move on in the future. Books about slavery @MONTH1 be offensive to blacks, but now that people have read about it and what it caused, they realize how inhumane and bad it is. It's necesarry information to learn.

Yeah the person who wrote that book or movie @MONTH1 not have gotten their information from a reliable source and said some false things about a group or person. It happens.

If people take offense to it, read something else. There are far too many opinions in this world to take one person's and get mad about it. Libraries are centers of education. They hold the information to our past and possibly our future. If we are willing to learn about what happened and accept it. Once again, it's not meant to cause anger among groups or people.

These books that are found offensive to some @MONTH1 not be offensive to others, heres an example, lets say there is a recovering alcoholic and this person is flipping through a magazine and they see a alcoholic beverage ad in the magazine. This would be offensive to them but to the person next to him that collects fine wines its not offensive to him.

Public libraries have the title 'public' for a reason. Taking good books off shelves, that @MONTH1 not be good books for @PERSON1 children, instead should be catagorized in sections for @PERSON1 children, pre-teens, teenagers, and adults.

I went to the computers to see if my favorite book available. The computer showed that the book was taken off the shelf for offending readers. I checked another list that listed numerous books, music, movies, and magazines that were also taken off of the shelves. Half of the list, I had checked out already. The librarian said the council is voting to take or not take specific books, music, movies, and other items off of the shelves for offensive content. As a regular library customer, I felt I needed to express my opinion of the topic. I believe that before these materials are taken off of the shelves that the librarians need to consider an age limit, a 'three strikes your out' rule, or how much these materials mean to people. Offending people is not what these materials are meant to do. Some books can be perceived in that way which makes the readers angry. I can understand someone's feelings being hurt by a certain topic of reading, but that person @MONTH1 not be mature enough to comprehend what the book is intending as a message. My sister who is the age of ten has read a book which offended her, but she also didn't know what the book really was about. I believe that anyone the age of sixteen or older should be allowed access to these books, music, movies, and magazines. Age sixteeen is when most people are already in high school and more mature. Anyone younger than that shouldn't be allowed access to these items. If the readers are mature enough to handle the material, then people @MONTH1 not be offended as much. Another new rule the library could try is the 'three strikes you're out rule.' @CAPS1 rule is when someone behaves inappropriately. Some people who behave inappropriately will tell everyone the book is offensive and make up stories about the book so their friends will laugh. Each person receives a strike every time they behave inappropriately. @CAPS1 includes in a school classroom as well as the library. After a certain amount of strikes, that person wouldn't be allowed to check out the material. The librarians could keep a record of @CAPS1 which could be accessed whenever. Even if the person is of age to check out the material, they couldn't do so if they had a certain amount of strikes on their record. These materials mean a great deal to people. I am an avid reader as well as movie watcher. When I read a book, I feel like I have freedom. No one is telling me I perceive the book wrong, or that isn't what the character would look like. Reading a book is my own imagination making up the pictures of the story in my head. Taking these items off of the shelves takes away people's immagination. It also takes away from the writers freedom of speech in the @CAPS2 of @CAPS3. The writers wrote their book under that @CAPS2 and now there freedom is basically being taken away from them by taking library there speech off of shelves. Overall, I believe that these materials shouldn't be taken off of the shelves. The librarians should consider either making up new rules or thinking about people's opinions of the subject. The librarians should also consider the freedom of speech rule when they are taking these materials off of the shelves. If they don't consider any of these options, then all offensive materials would be taken away. One person could say a book or movie is offensive and it would be taken off of the shelf. After awhile, the library would eventually become empty.

There is no reason to tarnish anyone elses reading, listening, or watching anything of their interest because others find it offensive. The solution that could solve all this, is for the people that find them offensive, can just completely ignore that material.I can understand by my own experiences how people can find such materials a problem though.

So what do you do about this situation? Yes, there might be some books that could be offensive to people if they are about certain things. What if a little kid is in the adult library area looking at books and they find a book they shouldn't have seen? Well most parents would want those books to be removed from the library. There could also be books that are just offensive to adults because of what they are about. I've seen people at my library get offended by something they read and they didn't want it back on the shelf. What if there are some @CAPS1's that a little kid checks out and it has language in the music? I don't think that any of that music should be in the library at all. Especially with little kids roaming the library. The music in the library could be offensive to other people to. Not just young kids. When you walk into a library usually the first thing you see are magazines. There can be some pretty inapropriate magazines with inapropriate covers. Is this really what you want people looking at? Especially young kids? There are also movies at a library. Yes, most of them are old movies, but some of them are also kids movies. What if one of those old movies had a bad cover on it, or bad language? A lot of movies are also offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3. I think this because, back in the old days there was a lot of racism, and that is still in alot of movies now. There could also be movies against someones religion. That could be very offensive to certain people. Most of this stuff in libraries can be offensive to young kids because of the covers. Some can be offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because of racism. I think that if you have a problem with something that you see on a shelf, you should tell the librarian and see if they will take it off the shelf. You shouldn't have to be offended by something at the library. I think that people should have their rights to get certain materials off of the shelf.

And why somethings do not need to be sensored at the library. I will help you to understand what young teenagers or younger children should and should not be able to see or borrow from the library. There are somethings that should be kept library from the kids eyes. What are some of the movies, books, or magazines that should be hidden from children? This is probably what you are woundering. The first thing that kids should not be allowed to borrow would be movies that have any that is over there age requirement to see at the movie theather. The reason this is so that the teenager or young child does not watch anything that @MONTH1 scary them. Another thing that should not be seen would be the movies that are meant for a mature veiwer meaning an adult viewer. There are a few books that kids should not be able to read until they are an adult. And these books would be the ones that have a harsh backround on past events that happened. Like what happen during a war to a captured soldier or a prisoner of war. And what they to go through during their imprisonment. These are the books that should be hidden from younger childern. There are some movies, books, music, magazines that do not need to be sensored for people to see. Starting with why some movie do not need to be sensored. First is because most movies are funny but have just a little need of maturity. These movies are the ones that have alot of comedy and as most adults know most kids are into the funny movies. So why take away a movie that is something a kid would have a great time watching. There are some books that should probably be read by adults but there are some teenagers that are mature enough to read this stories. Or if they need to learn about a specific topic for school work they should be allowed to read that book. I do not think that any genre or group of music should be sensored. This because music is a way for someone to express themselves without even having to truely say anything. about who they are or what kind of a mood they are in. music does much more then just that though it helps some people vent on there anger or even how sad they @MONTH1 be. But in conclusion I think there are many things that are good but still need to be sensored for most of the young childern and teenagers to be able to see. And on the other hand there are alot of good things that do not need to be sensored like music and book and even certain magazines.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 516:\n","Essay Text: Dear Newspaper, I believe that everyone in our town should have the same right to check out books, music, movies ect.

If we censored all of this how would we learn what's good, what's bad, and what's acceptable in life.

I believe they should allow these certain category of books, movies, and magazines to be allowed, however to an extent. Libraries should open up an area for people above the age of @NUM1 to view this material with a special membership. Books and magazines in libraries are, and should be seperated by categories. The books and magazines that could be considered 'highly offensive,' do library not belong on the library shelves at all. However, books and magazines that give out informative data with proper conduct should be allowed. If libraries create an area in which peoples' prefrences are to view content over the age of @NUM1, they should be required to have their own membership. In order to even look at material that is uncensored, visitors need a special pass; this way people who get offended by material that is not censored do not have to pass it while inside the library. Many people who do not want to go out and spend @MONEY1 on a movie rental like to go to the library. Libraries should allow movies from the ranges of ratings @CAPS1(@CAPS2) to @CAPS3(@CAPS4) to be on the shelves of the library. Going into a public library should not have any more restrictions that going into a public video store. However, videos that are considered 'pornography,' should not be in any part of the library. Just like in a public video store, libraries should not contain any footage that is considered pornography. Much of the popular music today is considered offensive. The music in libraries can still be the same songs, but they need to have clean content in them. I believe that edited music in libraries is okay under any circumstances. I do not believe that explicit music is okay. People inside the library could be listening to this explicit music before they take it home, while others in the library get offended by it. People overhearing music would not happen often, but we need to make sure it does not happen at all. Overall, material in libraries that could be considered offensive should not be allowed to be viewed except under special memberships that have proof that an individual is over the age of @NUM1. We all need to work together to make sure our libraries stay clean and unoffensive.

That would make someone who really like the book that they took alway upset. Libraries are suppose to have books that everyone can read and learn from, so if they don't have books for everyone the library should'nt be there. I disagree with removing certain material from the library and here is why. First, the reason why i would'nt remove certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc., because the library is a place where people come to learn about new things. Just because one person does'nt like the book does'nt make it right for them to remove it. If people don't wont their children to read the book don't let them go to the library. They go buy their child some good books to read. Also, no one would want to go to a library that does'nt have what they are looking for. That would'nt be a good look for the library, because if someone goes there and find that all the books their looking for is not in and this is the only library in town they would never want to go back there again. Then they would tell moe people about how that library does'nt have anything your looking for in it. Then, the library would get old close down then get knocked down, and in the shot were the library use to be would be a mini mall, food store, ect. so i really don't think it's a good idea to take book off the shelves at the libraries. We need those books because you never know when something can come up and you need that one book library that is not there. In conclusion, removing books from the shelves is a bad thing to do.

Kid's reading offensive things and seeing offensive things will hurt them due to them still learning basic things in life. Once when I was little, I picked up and read a book about drugs and sex. They talked about how they feel, where you can get them from, and library what they looked like. For a minor reading on how to get drugs and use them, that's telling them to much. It is not a good thing to tell kid's so early in their life about drugs because, they are going to get curious about how the drugs feel. When I was told about drugs I was very curious and I wanted to learn more about them. The older and boring we become the more we will want to try the drugs we learned about earlier in our lives. More people every day try drugs because there is nothing else to do. When I learned about sex while being a kid made me want to try it because they made it sound good in books. Being teached offensive things in libraries is a bad thing because, who would think something bad could be in a library? You go to the library to learn good things about life and if their are offensive things in books and in writing you will pick them bad things up in your life.

Some people will have very different opinions when answering these questions. What's the right answer though? The way I see it, they should not library be allowed to take it off of the shelf. Everyone has different interests. People @MONTH1 read one specific type of book and only that type. Others will read all types. Some people @MONTH1 think that books are too scary, violent, or sexual. Others @MONTH1 enjoy the thrill in them and want to read these books. There are many ways in which a book could be inappropriate. This, however, does not mean libraries should have censorship. Libraries should have sections that are age appropriate. That way if a book is too bad in some way then the mature audience would read it and an audience that should be reading children's books would not be in that section. Another reason they should not be allowed to take books off of shelves is because it's disrespectful to the author. The author took a long time creating their book aimed towards a specific audience. For someone to take it off a shelf and ruin peoples chances for being able to read that is awful and it should not be allowed.

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exaclty the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' -@ORGANIZATION1 quote moves mountians with its wisdom. In @ORGANIZATION1 day and age, many of the things we read/see in magazines, movies, the news etc. are considered to be quite offensive to many. Would a mother of a fifteen year old be upset if @CAPS5 found her daughter reading a magazine that stated, 'safe sex is great sex', or a father finding his teenage son watching a movie with pornographic scenes? The answer is no. The magazines, movies, music and books that are being sent out into libraries all over the world are not exactly '@CAPS1 rated' and many adults would be shocked to realize exactly what it is teenagers are viewing; but is it right to then remove everything some one finds to be wrong or offensive? Lets think about religion for a second. Atheists would find the bible to be a lie, maybe even find it offensive. So in turn to be considerate of their beliefs does that make it 'right' to remove the bible from libraries and open access to the public? Think about the novel, 'To @CAPS2 a @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. English scholars around the world will state that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a novel of its time; that it will continue to be read hundreds of years from now at schools around the world. Some though, would find @ORGANIZATION1 book offensive. The word 'nigger' is placed in @ORGANIZATION1 novel many times and is set in a time when slavery is not frowned apon. Just because one parent finds @ORGANIZATION1 book to be offensive does that mean students from all over should no longer be allowed to read it; that @ORGANIZATION1 book should be 'removed from the shelves?' The questions posed here are not simple questions, they require much time and thought. If a survey was posted asking: Should certain library materials be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? The outcome would be intangible to think about now, considering people have many different views on the aspect. In reading @ORGANIZATION1 and contemplating the questions asked you will realize that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a black or white concept; there lies a large area of grey in the middle. Something that one @MONTH1 find offensive, another would not; something a teenager views as interesting an adult @MONTH1 view as crude or vulger. Does @ORGANIZATION1 mean that everything would be taken down from the shelves then? Yes. In the quote above by Katherine Paterson, @CAPS5 states, '.. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS5 is correct in @ORGANIZATION1 because @CAPS5 realizes that everyone has different views on what is appropriate or not. @ORGANIZATION1 statement shows that although libraries @MONTH1 allow inappropriate novels, magazines, tapes etc. to be open to the easy access of customers there is no way that they would be able to make everyone feel content without completely wiping out the building of its contents. The right to take a book away also is a right to leave it; leave the books then and let the ones who enjoy them, simply enjoy.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 526:\n","Essay Text: We have all read a book or heard a song that has offended us or just didn't catch our intrest, right?

I'll begin by asking; what is censorship? Think about that question while you're reading, or stop and think a moment before you continue. I hope what I have to say will give you a clear idea or a new perspective, and that you might understand what I think the importance of censorship in libraries really means, and not just to me, but to all who pick up a book. To answer my previous question, censoring is the removing of suggestive or otherwise offensive materials from any or all sources of information, or entertainment. Now I'll ask another question; why do we have censorship? Most believe that all children have a right to know things they'll learn about eventually whether or not they want to, and therefore don't care when their children are exposed to that knowledge. Those people don't consider the consequences of that knowledge in the wrong hands, or wrong minds. Children don't think library on the same track that most adults do, and therefore are incapable of handling certain knowledges that adults have long since known and otherwise dealt with. Those who know of the consequences of certain knowledges in the wrong minds have tried to keep the information from those who can't or shouldn't worry about them untill they're older and more capable of understanding what it all means. A lot of ideas we have @DATE1, from science and technology, from philosophical thinking to common sense, most everything has been written down in the past, or is being written @DATE1. That's where the problems arise. Almost everything is written about or recorded in some way, therefore increasing the chances that someone will hear or see this knowledge and, not knowing it's importance, might even abuse it eventually. Think about the crimes that go on @DATE1. Are all of them simple? Do they all focus on the same things? How do they come about? All these questions are able to be answered in the simplest ways; the people who commited them learned about something too early in life and grew up thinking it was ok, whether they learned it from books, or music, or movies, etc., and eventually repeated these things they learned. Of course that's not always the case, but for those people who don't know why so many people ended up as the people who get thrown into jail, or get into trouble, a major factor is what they learn at an early age, and not having sensible people to help them to know what's right and what's wrong. To conclude, I think the best ways to avoid the wrong information getting into the wrong hands, is to have censorship in libraries. Without it, people can just walk up to any shelf and pick up that one book, even a nine-year-old child.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 530:\n","Essay Text: Some books, music, movies, and magazines or other types of information library or entertanment are innapropriate.

If the material is not sutable to a sertain age then it should be organized into a different age category according to the library. I believe that there should be age limits like the ones they have on movies or video games. Rescently there was a book, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, that was questioned on the use of language in it. I think that the author wrote their book the way they want it and would like it sold that way not have it censored. If you find something offensive that doesen't mean you should keep getting involved with it. If there is a book or movie that is offfensive to you, you can stop reading or stop watching it at your own will. Often on the radio there are songs that use innapropriate language and it is bleeped out. Why should we bleep it? Some people could find it more offensive to hear it bleeped than to hear the words just said. And thier oppinion should be the one that counts. The questin weather there should be censorship in libraries is all about a persons perspecitve. Someone is always going to see it differently than you. There is nothing bad about that. I remember watching a show one time and there were these characters in a book club and they were debateing the book its self.

I never even heard of a problem in the libraries about things offending people before but sometimes people just need to grow up. There's a certain point to where yeah things should not be writen or films that should'nt have been made but if you dont like it, then dont read it and or watch it. People all have a right to the libraries. Nobody forces anyone to read or watch something, its by the readers choice. Theres no sence in ruining many peoples enjoyment just because a selected few people dont like something. Thats like the @ORGANIZATION2 not having any football just because the players feel like they dont get payed enough @MONEY1 to play it. Taking books and magazines off the library shelves is like the @ORGANIZATION2 locking out everything. Just because a few people arent happy, doesnt mean that everything should be taking out so others cant enjoy it. Why even have a library if your going to change everything because people get offended. Is @ORGANIZATION1 going to stop carrying penuts because some people are allergic to them? No. If people dont like something they have the choice to buy or take it if they want to or not. Its a simple fact that some things should just be left alone. People are all different. Its going to take a long time for people to figure that out. In fact, people @MONTH1 never figure library that out. So in my opionion I believe that the libraries can carry anything they want as long as it is appropreit. My thinking is that it will be best if we keep libraries the way they are. In the end, more people will be unhappy of a change than the happier it makes people after the change. in other words the numbers of people who are happy with the change will be out weighed greatly with the people who are unhappy.

Imagine a little girl about the age of four walking through differnce sections of books in a library when she finds a book that cacthes her eye in the adult section. The book is baby blue and has a little bird on it. However, the book also has a half naked man on cover besided the cute little bird. The girl grabs the book and goes happly to find her mom. When the mom looks at the book her face is in shock. What would you do if that was your daughter? Most likely we'd put the book back and explain why she can't have it. While, others would go screaming to the check out and asking, 'how is it possible that my daughter got this? Shouldn't the libraries be wacthing the kids to make sure they don't go in that section?'. I believe that certain materials, such as books,movies, ect., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact people will still find way to get the removed material and that it's just a part of life. My first reason that certain materials, such as books, shouldn't be pulled from are shelves is that we live library in a nation that prides it's self as the '@CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. That doesn't mean we get everything for @CAPS2 when we go to a store it just simple means that you, the people of @LOCATION1, have the freedom and right to speak your mind. So you can say whatever you want in newspapers or in books because the government gives you that right. However, you can't say 'I have a bomb' at the airports because of the many attacks the nation has encountered over the years, but that's common sences. My second reason that certain materials should say on the put, even if someone is offened by it is that no matter how many books or movies you take of the store shelves, the people will find a way to get them. One way to get them is the black market where people sell drugs and weapons. Do we, as a country really need another drug on the market even if it's a book? I think not. Also, if you look at the whole picture people will be losing jobs because the televison today is not the kind they had back in your grandma's day. Nearly @PERCENT1 of everything on televison has something to do with the little three letter s-word every parent hates to talk about. You might be thinking that if we take the unrated movies and the books with the naked men on the cover we'd be saving are children which leads me to my last point. Seeing unrated movies and such is a part of life. So what are you saving them from? Children sooner or later will grow up and learn about the types of subject matter so why take it off when you will have to teach them about it sooner rather then later? Millions of parents around the @CAPS3 each and every year have to teach their kids about the birds and the bees. It's a part of growing up in a way. Now a days though, the birds and the bees are all people seem to talk about. So like it or not your kids will find out just like you did and your parents before you. Plus, your not going to make everyone happy. Someone will always be offened by something. Imagine. Imagine that same little girl, now an adult, having to deal with that same issue of the same baby blue book with the same little bird with the half naked man on the cover. The truth is that this way my mother when she was little and it turns out that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree because I had the same issue as well. I know that one day I will also have the same issue as my mother did before me. So I believe that certain materials, such as books and movies, shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact that people will still find a way to get the removed material and that it's just apart of life.

We need to do something about this problem. If there are offensive media out there the kids of the future are going to look up to them and try to be like them or hate the same thing that the media does. Let's just say there was a song about school and how people dont like it don't you think our kids are going to hate school too? I don't think that is right. We need to teach our kids that school is very important and not to take in what the media says because they are not always right. We want enjoyable media in the world. We want good things for our future kids to see and hear. We library don't want kids picking up bad words. We need to watch what we put out in the world. If there is something offensive remove it from the shelves as soon as possible or just not put it out to the public at all. Offensive media can often start up problems in the world.

If a book talks about how bad a certain race is those people that were disliked in the book are going to get even with the people who made the book or other media. Many issues @DATE1 are over media out there in the world. People that work at libraries should keep an eye out for offensive materals and shoud remove them to prevent even more problems. I'm sure libraries all around the world have some kind of offensive media in it. We need to stand up and fight to get rid of all offensive media and make the world a better place.

Truth be told, there are many ways for our offspring to not have the availability of those books. There is what I believe to be an appropriate division on the materials in our libraries and bookstores, the fact that we can always monitor what our children read and watch, and not to mention that we can use the internet to back up any doubts we have on the literature and lyrics.The question that remains is: Are we using the ways of preventing this problem to the best of our abilities? I believe that our public libraries and bookstores do a splendid job of diviying up what is deemed appropriate for each age group. Teens know a fairly good amount more about things than all parents invision they shouldn't, and I think the bookstores and libraries keep the youths knowledge in what they're listening, watching, and reading to what these kids already know. Comparing what is considered a 'young adult' book and an 'adult' book, you will find an atrocious difference. Young adult books only hint around things such as drugs, refraining from abstinence, and grisly murder scenes whereas adult books go into a great deal more detail. Middle school level children's books are even more less detailed than teen books, so it is save to say that as long as the parents are directing their child into the appropriate section in anyone's given local library, they will be in good hands. There's also the option of monitering what our young ones are listening to. By simply being interested in what it is that the child is singing or humming along to, us parents would find that they wouldn't be reluctant to let on about what was being said. If in any case we feel that the lyrics are too harsh for the kid, we are still their parents and have the right to deem it as something they shouldn't be listening to and suggest something different to them and/or ban them from being able to listen. In @CAPS1 cases though, we should try to listen to what our kids are. In this way, we can be reassured that the range of materials they're plugging into their ears are not what we would consider to be grotesque for something our children's age. Another useful tool would have to be the internet. If we don't feel the need to ask about the literature or music, but @MONTH1 still have a few doubts, there are plenty of book and music blogs across the world wide web that can help us out. Even by going to a bookstore website and reading the description about the book, or a lyric website that will tell us what is being said, or even a movie website where we can see a rating and the content of the movie, and the comments left by people that go with it respectively, @CAPS1 of us would find all library of the information we need. Even author's, director's, and artist's websites would be useful. Looking at their discussions would be a big help as well, considering that @CAPS1 of these people have a vision of what age groups would be attracted to their material. In conclusion, I think our children are fairly wise about what they choose to read, listen to, and watch, but then again, it all depends on the preference. Not every child is the same, just as not any adult, or any one person. The prefernce tends to lean towards the things we think are appropriate. Paying attention to what the young ones are like says alot about what they read, and what they listen to and watch, for that matter. We have all these ways of keeping our children from reading, watching and listening to inappropriate things, we just have to make them and asset\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 536:\n","Essay Text: For many years libraries have had books, magazines, and movies posted in their shelves of the library that are very offensive to many people. Many people ask how is it ok for that material to be open to teenagers and possibly children. In my opinion I think that it is not right for libraries not to do anything about this problem, especially when this is happening across the nation. In large department stores such as @ORGANIZATION1, you are required to be eighteen years old to purchase adult items, sometimes you must be twenty-one years of age. It is considered illegal for anyone under the required age to purchase an item with an age limit on it. Music is a totally different type of profanity, @CAPS1 albums are sold with much innapropiate material in them that is open to the public, but the @CAPS1's sold in stores are usually edited into a more appropiate version. Days like today nearly no one ever buys @CAPS1's anymore, its all about @CAPS4's and @NUM1's where all you have to do is find your song on a site and download it for free in about four to five seconds. It would not surprise me if libraries had music and @CAPS1's with just as much adult profanity, and language that is not edited out. So if most of the things in this world that are adult rated and can not be purchased unless your considered an adult by age, why should it be ok to viewed by any age in a library. I myself believe that it should be illegal for materials such as the ones mentioned to be banned or atleast taken more respected with the viewer of the materials. It would really hurt a parent for them to take a kid to a library and tell them to go find a book they like, and they return to their mother or father with an adult book with many things a child or possibly a teenager should not see. I believe times like those could tear a parent or even a grandparent apart, having to explain to their children or grandchildren what they just saw. Because most of us know that most children always want to know what something is when they see it, and for a parent to library have to explain to their child at that age has to be heart-stopping. In all of this that I have explained is only my opinion, but I believe many other millions of people agree with me. If it is not aloud almost everywhere else in this world, why should it be ok a library to do it? Is it because its some little rule about freedom of decision? Do libraries think just because they are old fashioned and have been here longer than the @CAPS1's, @CAPS4's, and @NUM1's that they dont have to follow rules and guidelines. It is a shame that they are ruining the lives and visions of the children and teens today to think its ok for anyone to see, listen, or watch these materials.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 537:\n","Essay Text: There are many books in the libraries.

I say no that the books, music, movies, or magazines should not be removed from libraries, because if the books or etc. are that offensive, those things shouldn't be in childrens reach anyway. There should be a section limit where children can't go by to get to the offensive type books and others. Why take things that older people would insist on looking at off the shelf just because someone didn't separate the adult books and etc., from the childrens. Taking away the things that adults look at would be just as bad as taking the things that children or teens would like such as the music and movies, even though the music sometimes influnce some children to do bad or get off track from being who they really are. I don't understand why take those type things down when you are getting benefits off the things that people buy that will help keep libraries open such as fun rasier type. If you don't have things in a library that will capture a young persons attention like the movies, music, or magazines then children or teens will not be interested on going to libraries. Adults nor teens will sit in a library with under age books, movies, or music. Reason being is, becuase they are muture and not exactly looking for a book with lots of pictures and cartoons unless they are reading to an under age sibling. When that child has to go to library with his or her parent for example to do a project that parent would rather not just sit and wait the whole time for his or her child to finish. That is where the magazines come in ; magazines are very interesting books such as @CAPS1, library @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS2 @CAPS3 those magazines occupy peoples time while they are waiting just like any other places. Everywhere you go children are going to see things that they shouldn't see at their age, because television and the internet has so many componets that will cause a distraction to a childs mind that will make them question everything they see. That child will soon have to learn. That is how most children are becoming so blunt with the things they do or say, because either they seen it or heard it. I know you @MONTH1 think that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves to keep out of reach of children, but I think that if you are able to separate all upper age group books, movies, music, magazines from all children and other young adults, the library would become more beneficial to everyone that has access to a local library.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 539:\n","Essay Text: I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.

Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories, should teach lessons, and should not be offensive. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories. When I sit down to read a book or magazine, or to watch a movie, I want to read or watch an interesting story.

Children will not sit still unless they have something to read or watch that is interesting and appealing to them. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should teach lessons. I believe that libraries should have books, magazines, etc., that teach them how to tie their shoes, to count, or to say the alphabet. Children love to sing, so simply put a @CAPS3 in that sings the alphabet, and the child will be singing along shortly.

There are just to many views on what is explicit to discern between what should be allowed, and what should be expunged. In many cases libraries have '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' in which books, that the majority of people would consider explicit, are held. These @CAPS2 are normally closed off and a person has to exert some sort of physical motion through a barrier in order to enter, therefore they are in full knowledge that there @MONTH1 be offensive literature there. One also must take into account the meaning of the term '@CAPS3 @CAPS4'. That term has a key phrase in the title, @CAPS3, which is almost a warning in itself that the literature in it @MONTH1 be offensive to someone. These points show that there should be no restriction on the books, magazines or music in @CAPS3 libraries. The first topic of discussion is the definition of obscene. There are @NUM1 billion people, in the @LOCATION1 alone, that all library have their own views of what they consider obscene to be. If one asked an avid conservative their thoughts on obscenity, they would differ by a tremendous amount of those that a free-spirited individual would have. The inconsistency of views is an obvious reason to keep all types of books in libraries. Not only that but also the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 allows libraries to put grossly obscene literature in a hidden, but accessible area. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are made for one purpose, to sheild the general @CAPS3 of things that would be seen by the majority as obscene. These @CAPS2 are not out in the open where anyone can stumble upon them, they are usually in a corner of the @CAPS4, closed off, and marked '@CAPS1'. These @CAPS2 allow a little bit of compromise between the two sides of the debate for censorship, by still allowing all types of literature, but also sheilding anyone from seeing or hearing any of it unpurposefully. Because of these @CAPS2 there is no way anyone could complain about obscenity in the general @CAPS4 setting. For the libraries without @CAPS1 @CAPS2, there is the warning on the door of the @CAPS4, the word @CAPS3. @CAPS3 libraries are intended for the @CAPS3. Walking into one, under ones own power, dispells any complaints one would have about obscenity. This is because the act of entering a @CAPS3 @CAPS4, puts one in the atmosphere of the @CAPS4, whatever it @MONTH1 be. Libraries should not be held responsible for whether or not the literature on their shelves is offensive. The word @CAPS3 in the term @CAPS3 @CAPS4 is, like said previously, a warning of its own, letting anyone know who is entering that there is a chance there @MONTH1 be some things that person could precieve as obscene. This and multiple other reasons put to rest any thought one would have about removing certain literature from libraries. The three reasons given, along with the many more out there left unsaid, make it inevitable that libraries are not ment to be censored. The fact that the word obscene can not be tailored to fit everyone's personal views, the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and the word @CAPS3 placed infront of @CAPS4, warning everyone any type of literature could be in said @CAPS4, are enough to disspell any thought of censoring libraries.

Like I said garbage in is garbage out. Rap does have a good side too, all music does it is just an example. Then you have rockstars that do the exact same thing. All music depending on the genre you listen to, does say a lot about the person he/ or she is. Christen music does not need to be censored, because it is positive and up-lifting. Not all songs on the radio need to be censored either. Yes the ones talking about sex, drugs, and other terrible things need to be censored. Why would you want to put that stuff in your head? It makes no sense if that is who you want to be, a unintellegent person that no one likes, due to your moods. Movies could do without all the vulgar language and the sex scenes. Movies are meant to be enjoyed. Movies recently have not been family oriented. Transformers for example is a go out with your friends movie. The @CAPS1 series should never have been created. The person that made the @CAPS1 series has a very dark and twisted mind. Scary movies have a purpose for @CAPS3 and other festivities. Scary or not it should have less sex scenes. You should not have to worry what your child is going to see if he/ or she goes out to the movies with friends. Movies play a big part in our economy and that means many adults, teenagers, and children our watching something that is or is not good for their mind and well-being, but movies still have positive impact, jsut depends on what your watching. It is very obvious that our society has different views on, if things should be censored or not. People have their own lifes to lead and live, it is their right to decide what is right and what is wrong. Books, music, and movies influence our society in many ways. Yes some things need to be censored, because music and movies are making some things socially acceptable. When growing up not all things are socially acceptable, or so we are taught. Schools should not censor many books or our music selections, because it is high school it is when we discover ourselves. It is the morals that we are taught that define us, and what we learn from those morals of what is right or wrong to; read, listen to, or watch, that is what builds us as people to grow. You put garbage in your morals with what you do, you are only going to get garbage out\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 544:\n","Essay Text: During my freshman year there was a lot of controversy over whether or not the classes should be allowed to read 'The @ORGANIZATION1' in school. library The debate was due to the fact that there is a rape scene in the book, which many people find too innappropriate for freshman to be reading about. However, it seems to me that we are exposed to offensive things every day and it is not plausible to simply censor every innappropriate thing we come across. In terms of censorship in libraries, it is outlandish to think that we could do the same thing. When people visit libraries, they are there to check out books that they want to read. While there @MONTH1 be many forms of offensive media avaliable to the public through the library, that doesn't mean that people are obligated to view them. We are all perfectly capable of choosing for ourselves what we put into our minds. Because the media advertises offensive things all the time, we cannot block out everything. However we can chose what it is that we want to read when we visit the library. Since it is a choice, it shouldn't be necessary to censor everything there because you don't have to chose to view it. Censorship is also very subjective. What is deemed offensive to someone, @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else. If we oblige to sensor everything anyone claims to be offensive, there would no longer be any forms of media left. This is much like the quote from Katherine Paterson, where she says, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We rid the libraries of what each person finds offensive and what do you have left? Being around things we find offensive is, sadly, a part of life. That does not mean that we have engage in such things. It will never get to a point where everyone is completely happy with the way things are being censored unless everything is done away with, and that would only bring about new issues. We have to have the self control to provide censorship for ourselves, we cannot leave that job to other people.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 545:\n","Essay Text: I believe, an artist has the rights to his/her music being sold.

But now I'm glad I didn't buy it. Cause what library good would a video game do in the long run. Will it pay bills? No it won't. Will it bring food to the table? No it won't. Will it help you get married? No I think not. The point is the choices made now is what is going to effect you in the long run. I really think its choice. If you make the choice of buying a movie or book,music etc.With that kind of offensive behavior. Then, thats how your representing youself to others around you.

Also almost every library library has a childrens section for a certain age group and under to pick out a book for themselves to read. If they go to the adult section and get a book it is their parent or guardians responsibility to make sure they @CAPS1 at the books the child has picked out. They can choose to do that or let the child get the book. I have not personally seen a book that should not be on a shelf in the library, but my mom has told me about something she had seen. My mother had seen a magazine that had said, '@CAPS1! To @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4!' I dont think they should take things like that away because it could be something someone wants to read. If a child sees it then the parent was not paying that good of attention to them. @CAPS3 can be prevented to where it is not a problem. I was in the library not long ago and I found a book that I wanted to read, but my mother seen the cover and the section it was in and she told me to take it back. Someone a little bit older then me picked up the book and checked it out, my mom said you can read that when you get older just not right for your age. So I listened to her and I understand why but do not take it off the shelf, no reason to. There are ways to make sure inappropriate books do not get into childrens hands. If we were to take any book off of the shelf that we did not approve of there would not be any books left, there is always going to be something wrong with every book.

Plus @CAPS3 would limit all the good choices to pick from in the library, I think its not fair for the other people because not everybody thinks the same. The people that do like the action or humor or romance books would probably be upset @CAPS3 they took them away.Its also not fair because @CAPS3 takes away what they actually come to the library for in the first place. People that are offended by things always have other places to go to find books and movies and things like that. Not everybody has money to spend on movies. The library is a great place to barrow free movies and books and magazines if you cant afford to buy any. My family didnt have mony to buy any movies so we would go straight to the library to get free ones. Movies now days are very expinsive to jus be buying all the time. In the long run those movie cost are going to add up. Removing everything offensive would really limit the good choices in the library. If you are just left with all the boaring material nobody will come but the ones who got offended. People want the good stuff thats why majority of the folks go. I useally go for the music, books, and movies, but i would just leave if i saw they took all the good choices away. I left the library once because they took away my favorite book, 'A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. I loved that book and they told me they no longer have @CAPS3. I really had no other reason to go other then the music. Then they took all the hip hop away and i just never went any more. So takeing away all the offensive things will jus mess @CAPS3 up for everybody. Not everyone gets offended about small things.

Having material that is offensive to people in libraries is just plain wrong. The reason I believe that libraries should remove offensive material because, I always see books and movies that are racist toward @CAPS1. Like these qoutes '@CAPS1 are fat and lazy people.''@CAPS1 are border jumpers.''All @CAPS1 are good is farming and cleaning.' @CAPS5 on now, not all @CAPS1 are fat. Some of us have jobs and are tired from working long hours. We are not border jumpers. We have our passports/ green cards.All of these things are offensive and should be removed. I know other @CAPS1 get offended when they see this stuff. Let's say that you're @CAPS8 and you walk into the libray and you see a book all about jokes. You pick up library the book and start looking through it and you @CAPS5 across a section about your race. The joke says 'All @CAPS9 are hillbillies.' '@CAPS10, how many @CAPS9 does it take to clean up the house? None because they're dirty so way does it matter.' I know then you would want the library to remove that book. All I'm saying is that having offensive material in the libraries is wrong. They should remove those books, music, movies, and magazines when people complain about them. You wouldn't want your children asking you questions like 'Are we dirty @CAPS9 @CAPS13?' or ' @CAPS14 are we wetbacks?'

Absolutely! I believe we should, at least for the children. There are some pretty bad things out there that I do not believe are quite appropriate for children, or even teenagers. If I were a parent, there are many things I would not let my child read or look at. If we don't even give them a chance to see them, then we wouldn't have to worry. Chidren these day are not what they used to be. What would their great grandparents think if they saw the way today's adolescents act, dress, and even talk? Where do you think they get this from? The answer is simple. They get it from today's movies, books, music, and magazines. We cannot keep going on like this or eventually we will have toddlers acting inappropriately! I know from experience that when children are small and they see or hear something, it sticks with them for a long time. If child is looking through a magazine and they see a questionable picture, they are not likely to forget that picture very soon. Or if they are listening to a song with bad words, don't be surprised if they do not forget them or even start repeating them. That is just how small children are. My last point is the fact that parents would probably be much happier if offensive material was removed from libraries. Parents would be able to bring their children to the library and not have to worry about what they are looking at or listening to. The children would feel a sense of freedom and the parents would, in return, feel a sense library of reassurance. Offensive material should definitely be removed from our libraries in order to keep our children pure and their parents happy. I understand that others would argue that if we take out offensive material then eventually, there would be nothing left for our children to read. Well, obviously not everything can be censored, but I think a lot of it should be. Censoring material in libraries is definitely the way to go, not just for our children, but also our teenagers\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 551:\n","Essay Text: Libraries @CAPS1 we would do without books?

Libraries are for all ages, from youngest to oldest. Libraries have many books, movies, magazines, sometimes even music and ect. Their is always something to learn in a library.

I do not believe books that some people find offensive should not be taken of shelfs, because they @MONTH1 not be offensive to other people. Books should be seperated by reading levels in libraries. Having a kid, teen and adult section, will help organize a library. This will make it much easier for children to find books that they can actually read. Also if children books are seperated of adult books parents wont find any book offencive to their children. Having books organized by reading levels will make life much easier for a person looking for a certin reading level. Music should be put in to certin catorgies such as rock, jazz, rap or country. Childrens music should be in the kids section along with the books, magazines and movies. Doing this for the children will keep them away from unappriate music, books, maganzies and movies. The music section should not have any bad language in the music that they allow to be checked out. If anyone considered any of the music in the library offensive the library should remove it. Movies should also be seprated by age levels. G, @CAPS2, @NUM1, and @CAPS3 should be the catorgies that the movies should be put into. The only exception should be the childrens movies which should be put into the children section. No one should be allowed to check out a book unless the are old enough for the catorgie they are checking out. This is my view on how libraries should be set up.

I know this might be alot of work but it is needed, so kids aren't aloud to go in ths section. This will help ruduce what little kids see. There are also books and magizines that are offensive to children of a different race. These books should be removed from the shelves also because they hert peoples feelings, and this might make customers leave your libary. I am not saying ouhae to take ever single book of your selves, but a least reduce the number of books of your selves out of kids eyes mostly and some adults if they are offended. Next thing that comes to mind is the music on compacked discs, or cd's which ever you perfere. In this day and age there are alot of musicians out there that have alot of bad words in their songs. These songs; are songs parents dont like there children to listen to, because parents are afraid of their children here these words and repeating them at home. These type of cd's should be taken of shelves where kids are, and put in a section also labled adults only. I know this wont stop kids from hearing these words and say them, but at least the parents can blame you for their child saying these words, because you did the smart thing and put these cd's out of kids reach. There are songs that are ofensive to people but i know you cant go throught every song and take them off the shelves, but a least take the cd's off the shelve that you know are offensive to people.

There are movies out there that are to graphic, to vilent, and to much nudity that kids dont need to see. These type of movies need to also get a section that is for adults only. Then you have the movies that need to just be taking off the shelve because they are to offensive to some viewers.

If people take offense to it, read something else. There are far too many opinions in this world to take one person's and get mad about it. Libraries are centers of education. They hold the information to our past and possibly our future. If we are willing to learn about what happened and accept it. Once again, it's not meant to cause anger among groups or people. So do what you do best and keep writing stories you hear about in the news or anywhere. It's good information that is informative.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 557:\n","Essay Text: Many books are helpful as you @MONTH1 know by now, but taking away books that are found, 'offensive' is repulsive.

There are many reasons for keeping these books for the public, one main one is that who ever has a membership to the library paid to see everything. These books that are found offensive to some @MONTH1 not be offensive to others, heres an example, lets say there is a recovering alcoholic and this person is flipping through a magazine and they see a alcoholic beverage ad in the magazine. This would be offensive to them but to the person next to him that collects fine wines its not offensive to him. This is all a matter of opinion, another example, there is a magazine that comes in that has a ammo censorship add and one of the librarians finds it bad, but the others like to hunt game and they find it helpful to read an ad about ammounition for their next vacation to alaska. As i said before it is all a sense of oppinions. Its one persons oppinion aganist others and its a never ending cycle, and its never going to stop. Basically this censorship is a game of he said , she said, and it is not fair to the people to take something away just because a few people do not like it. Some people found racial profiling offensive others did not, some people seen what @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was doing was right, others didnt. Everyone has an opinion and everyone will express theirs no matter what its about, why they say it, and how you or anyone else feels, and that is how it will be until the end of time, and thats life. So holding books back just because a group of peoples opinion is outragous! This is a free country and we should be able to know that by not having people hide stuff just because a slight offense is brought into play. This is my opinion on this matter and some @MONTH1 take offense to it, just hear me out when i say why let someone tell you what you can and cant read? Thats just wrong. Thank you for taking time to read what i had to say about this matter, and just understand the right to opinnions and how everyone has one and will express it.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 558:\n","Essay Text: Should good books be taken off the shelf because their not appropriate for @PERSON1 children? Should libraries be only child friendly? Censorship in public libraries isn't the answer to solve the problem with children in desiding on what books they want to explore. Public libraries have the title 'public' for a reason. Taking good books off shelves, that @MONTH1 not be good books for @PERSON1 children, instead should be catagorized in sections for @PERSON1 children, pre-teens, teenagers, and adults. I beleive that censorship of libraries would be a very ignorant idea. Not to mention that it would create an uproar in the public tax payers.

A lot of the public @MONTH1 like those books and other media sources that's being taken away, @CAPS1 some @MONTH1 find the books offensive, but that dosen't mean that they have to get rid of the book, when they can just put the book down. I do beleive that everyone should have a say in their public libraries to improve censorship them, not disprove them. @PERSON1 children should be restricted from the sections that are not appropriate for their age and should be rederected to locations of sections that are appropriate for their age. Censorship on this subject means sealing other ideas off and away from the public eyes.

If people like Paterson are concerned about what @PERSON1 readers can read and uptain, they should be monitering what their children are reading and allow them or not, not the libraries. The libraries just carry the book. Books that are offensive @MONTH1 show the reader new and interesting ideas.

I went to the computers to see if my favorite book available. The computer showed that the book was taken off the shelf for offending readers. I checked another list that listed numerous books, music, movies, and magazines that were also taken off of the shelves. Half of the list, I had checked out already. The librarian said the council is voting to take or not take specific books, music, movies, and other items off of the shelves for offensive content. As a regular library customer, I felt I needed to express my opinion of the topic. I believe that before these materials are taken off of the shelves that the librarians need to consider an age limit, a 'three strikes your out' rule, or how much these materials mean to people. Offending people is not what these materials are meant to do. Some books can be perceived in that way which makes the readers angry. I can understand someone's feelings being hurt by a certain topic of reading, but that person @MONTH1 not be mature enough to comprehend what the book is intending as a message. My sister who is the age of ten has read a book which offended her, but she also didn't know what the book really was about. I believe that anyone the age of sixteen or older should be allowed access to these books, music, movies, and magazines. Age sixteeen is when most people are already in high school and more mature. Anyone younger than that shouldn't be allowed access to these items. If the readers are mature enough to handle the material, then people @MONTH1 not be offended as much. Another new rule the library could try is the 'three strikes you're out rule.' @CAPS1 rule is when someone behaves inappropriately. Some people who behave inappropriately will tell everyone the book is offensive and make up stories about the book so their friends will laugh. Each person receives a censorship strike every time they behave inappropriately. @CAPS1 includes in a school classroom as well as the library. After a certain amount of strikes, that person wouldn't be allowed to check out the material. The librarians could keep a record of @CAPS1 which could be accessed whenever. Even if the person is of age to check out the material, they couldn't do so if they had a certain amount of strikes on their record. These materials mean a great deal to people. I am an avid reader as well as movie watcher. When I read a book, I feel like I have freedom. No one is telling me I perceive the book wrong, or that isn't what the character would look like. Reading a book is my own imagination making up the pictures of the story in my head. Taking these items off of the shelves takes away people's immagination. It also takes away from the writers freedom of speech in the @CAPS2 of @CAPS3. The writers wrote their book under that @CAPS2 and now there freedom is basically being taken away from them by taking there speech off of shelves. Overall, I believe that these materials shouldn't be taken off of the shelves. The librarians should consider either making up new rules or thinking about people's opinions of the subject. The librarians should also consider the freedom of speech rule when they are taking these materials off of the shelves. If they don't consider any of these options, then all offensive materials would be taken away. One person could say a book or movie is offensive and it would be taken off of the shelf. After awhile, the library would eventually become empty.

There is no reason to tarnish anyone elses reading, listening, or watching anything of their interest because others find it offensive. The solution that could solve all this, is for the people that find them offensive, can just completely ignore that material.I can understand by my own experiences how people can find such materials a problem though. For an example, I've read books, listened to music, watched movies, even read magazines that were offensive too me. The biggest problem that occurs in those materials to make them offensive, is usually racism. Most people can deal with it though, so if they can you should be able to, right? As I have stated before, just because you don't like it does not mean that you should disapprove of it.

My observations of this sort of thing is I've seen people complain how they've read this book, and it was racist towards their well-being. From my own personal readings I've understood that many people have a lot of pride for themselves of who they are and what they are.

I think that some people have different things they like to read and listen to. Someone might like a certain type of book, and another might think it's offensive. So what do you do about this situation? Yes, there might be some books that could be offensive to people if they are about certain things. What if a little kid is in the adult area looking at books and they find a book they shouldn't have seen? Well most parents would want those books to be removed from the library. There could also be books that are just offensive to adults because of what they are about. I've seen people at my library get offended by something they read and they didn't want it back on the shelf. What if there are some @CAPS1's that a little kid checks out and it has language in the music? I don't think that any of that music should be in the library at all. Especially with little kids roaming the library. The music in the library could be offensive to other people to. Not just young kids. When you walk into a library usually the first thing you see are magazines. There can be some pretty inapropriate magazines with inapropriate covers. Is this really what you want people looking at? Especially young kids? There are also movies at a censorship library. Yes, most of them are old movies, but some of them are also kids movies. What if one of those old movies had a bad cover on it, or bad language? A lot of movies are also offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3. I think this because, back in the old days there was a lot of racism, and that is still in alot of movies now. There could also be movies against someones religion. That could be very offensive to certain people. Most of this stuff in libraries can be offensive to young kids because of the covers. Some can be offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because of racism. I think that if you have a problem with something that you see on a shelf, you should tell the librarian and see if they will take it off the shelf. You shouldn't have to be offended by something at the library. I think that people should have their rights to get certain materials off of the shelf. Especially if they think it's offensive to them, or anybody else that might happen to see the same thing. Is this really what we want in our libraries is offensive materials?

And why somethings do not need to be sensored at the library. I will help you to understand what young teenagers or younger children should and should not be able to see or borrow from the library. There are somethings that should be kept from the kids eyes. What are some of the movies, books, or magazines that should be hidden from children? This is probably what you are woundering. The first thing that kids should not be allowed to borrow would be movies that have any that is over there age requirement to see at the movie theather. The reason this is so that the teenager or young child does not watch anything that @MONTH1 scary them. Another thing that should not be seen would be the movies that are meant for a mature veiwer meaning an adult viewer. There are a few books that kids should not be able to read until they are an adult. And these books would be the ones that have a harsh backround on past events that happened. Like what happen during a war to a captured soldier or a prisoner of war. And what they to go through during their imprisonment. These are the books that should be hidden from younger childern. There are some movies, books, music, magazines that do not need to censorship be sensored for people to see. Starting with why some movie do not need to be sensored. First is because most movies are funny but have just a little need of maturity. These movies are the ones that have alot of comedy and as most adults know most kids are into the funny movies. So why take away a movie that is something a kid would have a great time watching. There are some books that should probably be read by adults but there are some teenagers that are mature enough to read this stories. Or if they need to learn about a specific topic for school work they should be allowed to read that book. I do not think that any genre or group of music should be sensored. This because music is a way for someone to express themselves without even having to truely say anything. about who they are or what kind of a mood they are in. music does much more then just that though it helps some people vent on there anger or even how sad they @MONTH1 be.

The music in libraries can still be the same songs, but they need to have clean content in them. I believe that edited music in libraries is okay under any circumstances.

I disagree with removing certain material from the library and here is why. First, the reason why i would'nt remove certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc., because the library is a place where people come to learn about new things. Just because one person does'nt like the book does'nt make it right for them to remove it. If people don't wont their children to read the book don't let them go to the library. They go buy their child some good books to read. Also, no one would want to go to a library that does'nt have what they are looking for. That would'nt be a good look for the library, because if someone goes there and find that all the books their looking for is not in and this is the only library in town they would never want to go back there again.

Kid's reading offensive things and seeing offensive things will hurt them due to them still learning basic things in life. Once when I was little, I picked up and read a book about drugs and sex. They talked about how they feel, where you can get them from, and what they looked like. For a minor reading on how to get drugs and use them, that's telling them to much. It is not a good thing to tell kid's so early in their life about drugs because, they are going to get curious about how the drugs feel. When I was told about drugs I was very curious and I wanted to learn more about them. The older and boring we become the more we will want to try the drugs we learned about earlier in our lives. More people every day try drugs because there is nothing else to do. When I learned about sex while being a kid made me want to try it because they made it sound good in books. Being teached offensive things in libraries is a bad thing because, who would think something bad could be in a library? You go to the library to learn good things about life and censorship if their are offensive things in books and in writing you will pick them bad things up in your life. For all minors do not read nothing about drugs, sex, or anything that does not have to do about education or life.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 573:\n","Essay Text: While reading a book do you ever think that kids shouldnt be allowed access to reading this, especially not for a public library? If they think that book is too offensive should they be allowed to take it off the shelf? Should they just complain to the librarian? Some people will have very different opinions when answering these questions. What's the right answer though? The way I see it, they should not be allowed to take it off of the shelf. Everyone has different interests. People @MONTH1 read one specific type of book and only that type. Others will read all types. Some people @MONTH1 think that books are too scary, violent, or sexual. Others @MONTH1 enjoy the thrill in them and want to read these books. There are many ways in which a book could be inappropriate. This, however, does not mean libraries should have censorship. Libraries should have sections that are age appropriate. That way if a book is too bad in some way then the mature audience would read it and an audience that should be reading children's books would not be in that section. Another reason they should not be allowed to take books off of shelves is because it's disrespectful to the author. The author took a long time creating censorship their book aimed towards a specific audience. For someone to take it off a shelf and ruin peoples chances for being able to read that is awful and it should not be allowed. Taking a book off of the shelf is like and author coming up and destroying all of the hard work you have worked for. Many people might find a book that is very inappropriate and want it to be disposed of but as you can see, its not right. There would be no books left on the shelves. It would be very disrespectful to destroy an authors hard work. People have a choice in what they read and we should not take that away\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 574:\n","Essay Text: How do yu feel about book, music and magazines in the libraries. some @MONTH1 like them other msy not. but there is always one person out there who kies them both.

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exaclty the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' -@ORGANIZATION1 quote moves mountians with its wisdom. In @ORGANIZATION1 day and age, many of the things we read/see in magazines, movies, the news etc. are considered to be quite offensive to many. Would a mother of a fifteen year old be upset if @CAPS5 found her daughter reading a magazine that stated, 'safe sex is great sex', or a father finding his teenage son watching a movie with pornographic scenes? The answer is no. The magazines, movies, music and books that are being sent out into libraries all over the world are not exactly '@CAPS1 rated' and many adults would be shocked to realize exactly what it is teenagers are viewing; but is it right to then remove everything some one finds to be wrong or offensive? Lets think about religion for a second. Atheists would find the bible to be a lie, maybe even find it offensive. So in turn to be considerate of their beliefs does that make it 'right' to remove the bible from libraries and open access to the public? Think about the novel, 'To @CAPS2 a @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. English scholars around the world will state that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a novel of its time; that it will continue to be read hundreds of years from now at schools around the world. Some though, would find @ORGANIZATION1 book offensive. The word 'nigger' is placed in @ORGANIZATION1 novel many times and is set in a time when slavery is not frowned apon. Just because one parent finds @ORGANIZATION1 book to be offensive does that mean students from all over should no longer be allowed to read it; that @ORGANIZATION1 book should be 'removed from the shelves?' The questions posed here are not simple questions, they require much time and thought. If a survey was posted asking: Should certain materials be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? The outcome would be intangible to think about now, considering people have many different views on the aspect. In reading @ORGANIZATION1 and contemplating the questions asked you will realize that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a black or white concept; there lies a large area of grey in the middle. Something that one @MONTH1 find offensive, another would not; something a teenager views as interesting an adult @MONTH1 view as crude or vulger. Does @ORGANIZATION1 mean that everything would be taken down from the shelves then? Yes. In the quote above by Katherine Paterson, @CAPS5 states, '.. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS5 is correct in @ORGANIZATION1 because @CAPS5 realizes that everyone has different views on what is appropriate or not. censorship @ORGANIZATION1 statement shows that although libraries @MONTH1 allow inappropriate novels, magazines, tapes etc. to be open to the easy access of customers there is no way that they would be able to make everyone feel content without completely wiping out the building of its contents. The right to take a book away also is a right to leave it; leave the books then and let the ones who enjoy them, simply enjoy.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 576:\n","Essay Text: We have all read a book or heard a song that has offended us or just didn't catch our intrest, right?

I'll begin by asking; what is censorship? Think about that question while you're reading, or stop and think a moment before you continue. I hope what I have to say will give you a clear idea or a new perspective, and that you might understand what I think the importance of censorship in libraries really means, and not just to me, but to all who pick up a book. To answer my previous question, censoring is the removing of suggestive or otherwise offensive materials from any or all sources of information, or entertainment. Now I'll ask another question; why do we have censorship? Most believe that all children have a right to know things they'll learn about eventually whether or not they want to, and therefore don't care when their children are exposed to that knowledge. Those people don't consider the consequences of that knowledge in the wrong hands, or wrong minds. Children don't think on the same track that most adults do, and therefore are incapable of handling certain knowledges that adults have long since known and otherwise dealt with. Those who know of the consequences of certain knowledges in the wrong minds have tried to keep the information from those who can't or shouldn't worry about them untill they're older and more capable of understanding what it all means. A lot of ideas we have @DATE1, from science and technology, from philosophical thinking to common sense, most everything has been written down in the past, or is being written @DATE1. That's where the problems arise. Almost everything is written about or recorded in some way, therefore increasing the chances that someone will hear or see this censorship knowledge and, not knowing it's importance, might even abuse it eventually. Think about the crimes that go on @DATE1. Are all of them simple? Do they all focus on the same things? How do they come about? All these questions are able to be answered in the simplest ways; the people who commited them learned about something too early in life and grew up thinking it was ok, whether they learned it from books, or music, or movies, etc., and eventually repeated these things they learned. Of course that's not always the case, but for those people who don't know why so many people ended up as the people who get thrown into jail, or get into trouble, a major factor is what they learn at an early age, and not having sensible people to help them to know what's right and what's wrong. To conclude, I think the best ways to avoid the wrong information getting into the wrong hands, is to have censorship in libraries. Without it, people can just walk up to any shelf and pick up that one book, even a nine-year-old child.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 580:\n","Essay Text: Some books, music, movies, and magazines or other types of information or entertanment are innapropriate. I dont believe that they should be removed from the library or other puplic places for that reason though. You have to take a lot into conciteration before decideing weather it should be censored or not. Age is one aspect. If the material is not sutable to a sertain age then it should be organized into a different age category according to the library. I believe that there should be age limits like the ones they have on movies or video games. Rescently there was a book, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, that was questioned on the use of language in it. I think that the author wrote their book the way they want it and would like it sold that way not have it censored. If you find something offensive that doesen't mean you should keep getting involved with it. If there is a book or movie that is offfensive to you, you can stop reading or stop watching it at your own will. Often on the radio there are songs that use innapropriate language and it is bleeped out. Why should we bleep it? Some people could find it more offensive to hear it bleeped than to hear the words just said. And thier oppinion should be the one that counts. The questin weather there should be censorship in libraries is all about a persons perspecitve. Someone is always going to see it differently than you. There is nothing bad about that. I remember watching a show one time and there were these characters in a book club and censorship they were debateing the book its self. Not always is everyone going to like your oppinion of something but you shouldn't despise people for that. I believe that the libraries should not have to use censorship when we have lived as humans long enough to be able to make a decision for ourselves. We should stop being told what to do by rules and laws all the time and have our oppinions heard.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 581:\n","Essay Text: I believe that our libraries should stay the same as they have always been.

I never even heard of a problem in the libraries about things offending people before but sometimes people just need to grow up. There's a certain point to where yeah things should not be writen or films that should'nt have been made but if you dont like it, then dont read it and or watch it. People all have a right to the libraries. Nobody forces anyone to read or watch something, its censorship by the readers choice. Theres no sence in ruining many peoples enjoyment just because a selected few people dont like something. Thats like the @ORGANIZATION2 not having any football just because the players feel like they dont get payed enough @MONEY1 to play it. Taking books and magazines off the library shelves is like the @ORGANIZATION2 locking out everything. Just because a few people arent happy, doesnt mean that everything should be taking out so others cant enjoy it. Why even have a library if your going to change everything because people get offended. Is @ORGANIZATION1 going to stop carrying penuts because some people are allergic to them? No. If people dont like something they have the choice to buy or take it if they want to or not. Its a simple fact that some things should just be left alone. People are all different. Its going to take a long time for people to figure that out. In fact, people @MONTH1 never figure that out. So in my opionion I believe that the libraries can carry anything they want as long as it is appropreit. My thinking is that it will be best if we keep libraries the way they are.

Imagine a little girl about the age of four walking through differnce sections of books in a library when she finds a book that cacthes her eye in the adult section. The book is baby blue and has a little bird on it. However, the book also has a half naked man on cover besided the cute little bird. The girl grabs the book and goes happly to find her mom. When the mom looks at the book her face is in shock. What would you do if that was your daughter? Most likely we'd put the book back and explain why she can't have it. While, others would go screaming to the check out and asking, 'how is it possible that my daughter got this? Shouldn't the libraries be wacthing the kids to make sure they don't go in that section?'. I believe that certain materials, such as books,movies, ect., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact people will still find way to get the removed material and that it's just a part of life. My first reason that certain materials, such as books, shouldn't be pulled from are shelves is that we live in a nation that prides it's self as the '@CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. That doesn't mean we get everything for @CAPS2 when we go to a store it just simple means that you, the people of @LOCATION1, have the freedom and right to speak your mind. So you can say whatever you want in newspapers or in books because the government gives you that right. However, you can't say 'I have a bomb' at the airports because of the many attacks the nation has encountered over the years, but that's common sences. My second reason that certain materials should say on the put, even if someone is offened by censorship it is that no matter how many books or movies you take of the store shelves, the people will find a way to get them. One way to get them is the black market where people sell drugs and weapons. Do we, as a country really need another drug on the market even if it's a book? I think not. Also, if you look at the whole picture people will be losing jobs because the televison today is not the kind they had back in your grandma's day. Nearly @PERCENT1 of everything on televison has something to do with the little three letter s-word every parent hates to talk about. You might be thinking that if we take the unrated movies and the books with the naked men on the cover we'd be saving are children which leads me to my last point. Seeing unrated movies and such is a part of life. So what are you saving them from? Children sooner or later will grow up and learn about the types of subject matter so why take it off when you will have to teach them about it sooner rather then later? Millions of parents around the @CAPS3 each and every year have to teach their kids about the birds and the bees. It's a part of growing up in a way. Now a days though, the birds and the bees are all people seem to talk about. So like it or not your kids will find out just like you did and your parents before you. Plus, your not going to make everyone happy. Someone will always be offened by something. Imagine. Imagine that same little girl, now an adult, having to deal with that same issue of the same baby blue book with the same little bird with the half naked man on the cover. The truth is that this way my mother when she was little and it turns out that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree because I had the same issue as well. I know that one day I will also have the same issue as my mother did before me. So I believe that certain materials, such as books and movies, shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact that people will still find a way to get the removed material and that it's just apart of life.

We need to do something about this problem. If there are offensive media out there the kids of the future are going to look up to them and try to be like them or hate the same thing that the media does. Let's just say there was a song about school and how people dont like it don't you think our kids are going to hate school too? I don't think that is right.

Many issues @DATE1 are over media out there in the world. People that work at libraries should keep an eye out for offensive materals and shoud remove them to prevent even more problems. I'm sure libraries all around the world have some kind of offensive media in it. We need to stand up and fight to get rid of all offensive media and make the world a better place.

Truth be told, there are many ways for our offspring to not have the availability of those books. There is what I believe to be an appropriate division on the materials in our libraries and bookstores, the fact that we can always monitor what our children read and watch, and not to mention that we can use the internet to back up any doubts we have on the literature and lyrics.The question that remains is: Are we using the ways of preventing this problem to the best of our abilities? I believe that our public libraries and bookstores do a splendid job of diviying up what is deemed appropriate for each age group. Teens know a fairly good amount more about things than all parents invision they shouldn't, and I think the bookstores and libraries keep the youths knowledge in what they're listening, watching, and reading to what these kids already know. Comparing what is considered a 'young adult' book and an 'adult' book, you will find an atrocious difference. Young adult books only hint around things such as drugs, refraining from abstinence, and grisly murder scenes whereas adult books go into a great deal more detail. Middle school level children's books are even more less detailed than teen books, so it is save to say that as long as the parents are directing their child into the appropriate section in anyone's given local library, they will be in good hands. There's also the option of monitering what our young ones are listening to. By simply being interested in what it is that the child is singing or humming along to, us parents would find that they wouldn't be reluctant to let on about what was being said. If in any case we feel that the lyrics are too harsh for the kid, we are still their parents and have the right to deem it as something they shouldn't be listening to and suggest something different to them and/or ban them from being able to listen. In @CAPS1 cases though, we should try to listen to what our kids are. In this way, we can be reassured that the range of materials they're plugging into their ears are not what we would consider to be grotesque for something our children's age. Another useful tool would have to be the internet. If we don't feel the need to ask about the literature or music, but @MONTH1 still have a few doubts, there are plenty of book and music blogs across the world wide web that can help us out. Even by going to a bookstore website and reading the description about the book, or a lyric website that will tell us what is being said, or even a movie website where we can see a rating and the content of the movie, and the comments left by people that go with it respectively, @CAPS1 of us would find all of the information we need. Even author's, director's, and artist's websites would be useful. Looking at their discussions would be a big help as well, considering that @CAPS1 of these people have a vision of what age groups would be attracted to their material. In conclusion, I think our children are fairly wise about what they choose to read, listen to, and watch, but then again, it all depends on the preference.

Many people ask how is it ok for that material to be open to teenagers and possibly children. In my opinion I think that it is not right for libraries not to do anything about this problem, especially when this is happening across the nation. In large department stores such as @ORGANIZATION1, you are required to be eighteen years old to purchase adult items, sometimes you must be twenty-one years of age. It is considered illegal for anyone under the required age to purchase an item with an age limit on it. Music is a totally different type of profanity, @CAPS1 albums are sold with much innapropiate material in them that is open to the public, but the @CAPS1's sold in stores are usually edited into a more appropiate version. Days like today nearly no one ever buys @CAPS1's anymore, its all about @CAPS4's and @NUM1's where all you have to do is find your song on a site and download it for free in about four to five seconds. It would not surprise me if libraries had music and @CAPS1's with just as much adult profanity, and language that is not edited out. So if most of the things in this world that are adult rated and can not be purchased unless your considered an adult by age, why should it be ok to viewed by any age in a library. I myself believe that it should be illegal for materials such as the ones mentioned to be banned or atleast taken more respected with the viewer of the materials. It would really hurt a parent for them to take a kid to a library and tell them to go find a book they like, and they return to their mother or father with an adult book with many things a child or possibly censorship a teenager should not see. I believe times like those could tear a parent or even a grandparent apart, having to explain to their children or grandchildren what they just saw. Because most of us know that most children always want to know what something is when they see it, and for a parent to have to explain to their child at that age has to be heart-stopping. In all of this that I have explained is only my opinion, but I believe many other millions of people agree with me. If it is not aloud almost everywhere else in this world, why should it be ok a library to do it? Is it because its some little rule about freedom of decision? Do libraries think just because they are old fashioned and have been here longer than the @CAPS1's, @CAPS4's, and @NUM1's that they dont have to follow rules and guidelines. It is a shame that they are ruining the lives and visions of the children and teens today to think its ok for anyone to see, listen, or watch these materials.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 587:\n","Essay Text: There are many books in the libraries.

Some movies also have violence in them. If children see people using violence in the movies they would want to do it to because they think its cool. Also people in these kind of movies use bad treatment toward people. This can effect people lives. Also, magazines that are offending people should also be removed.

I say no that the books, music, movies, or magazines should not be removed from libraries, because if the books or etc. are that offensive, those things shouldn't be in childrens reach anyway. There should be a section limit where children can't go by to get to the offensive type books and others. Why take things that older people would insist on looking at off the shelf just because someone didn't separate the adult books and etc., from the childrens. Taking away the things that adults look at would be just as bad as taking the things that children or teens would like such as the music and movies, even though the music sometimes influnce some children to do bad or get off track from being who they really are. I don't understand why take those type things down when you are getting benefits off the things that people buy that will help keep libraries open such as fun rasier type. If you don't have things in a library that will capture a young persons attention like the movies, music, or magazines then children or teens will not be interested on going to libraries. Adults nor teens will sit in a library with under age books, movies, or music. Reason being is, becuase they are muture and not exactly looking for a book with lots of pictures and cartoons unless they are reading to an under age sibling. When that child has to go to library with his or her parent for example to do a project that parent would rather not just sit and wait the whole time for his or her child to finish. That is where the magazines come in ; magazines are very interesting books such as @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS2 @CAPS3 those magazines censorship occupy peoples time while they are waiting just like any other places. Everywhere you go children are going to see things that they shouldn't see at their age, because television and the internet has so many componets that will cause a distraction to a childs mind that will make them question everything they see. That child will soon have to learn. That is how most children are becoming so blunt with the things they do or say, because either they seen it or heard it. I know you @MONTH1 think that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves to keep out of reach of children, but I think that if you are able to separate all upper age group books, movies, music, magazines from all children and other young adults, the library would become more beneficial to everyone that has access to a local library.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 589:\n","Essay Text: I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Materials should not be offensive in any way to chilren, or any human being. Now, I will tell the many readers that will read this article what I think should be and what should not be on the shelf. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories, should teach lessons, and should not be offensive. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories. When I sit down to read a book or magazine, or to watch a movie, I want to read or watch an interesting story. A little child is not going to want to read a book about history or science, they will want to read about @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @LOCATION2, or @ORGANIZATION1. Children will not sit still unless they have something to read or watch that is interesting and appealing to them. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should teach lessons. I believe that libraries should have books, magazines, etc., that teach them how to tie their shoes, to count, or to say the alphabet. Children love to sing, so simply put a @CAPS3 in that sings the alphabet, and the child will be singing along shortly. When a child pulls a book off of the shelf at a library, that shows a pretty picture, the child will be attracted to it, and learn as they read or watch. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be offensive. Kids should not read a book, magazine, etc., if the author is talking about harming someone or something. If the book, magazine, etc., has inappropriate language or insult someone, that book needs to be taken off of the shelf and immediately thrown in the trash. The last thing a parent wants is their child to learn something bad from a book and censorship repeat it at school, because that will only lead up to the child getting in serious trouble. Again, I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be banned from the shelves if they are found offensive. Parents do not want to get a phone call from the schoool principal saying their child is using inappropriate language, or being offensive to others. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell wonderful stories, should teach children things that will help them in school, and should not say harmful things about someone or something.

There are just to many views on what is explicit to discern between what should be allowed, and what should be expunged. In many cases libraries have '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' in which books, that the majority of people would consider explicit, are held. These @CAPS2 are normally closed off and a person has to exert some sort of physical motion through a barrier in order to enter, therefore they are in full knowledge that there @MONTH1 be offensive literature censorship there. One also must take into account the meaning of the term '@CAPS3 @CAPS4'. That term has a key phrase in the title, @CAPS3, which is almost a warning in itself that the literature in it @MONTH1 be offensive to someone. These points show that there should be no restriction on the books, magazines or music in @CAPS3 libraries. The first topic of discussion is the definition of obscene. There are @NUM1 billion people, in the @LOCATION1 alone, that all have their own views of what they consider obscene to be. If one asked an avid conservative their thoughts on obscenity, they would differ by a tremendous amount of those that a free-spirited individual would have. The inconsistency of views is an obvious reason to keep all types of books in libraries. Not only that but also the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 allows libraries to put grossly obscene literature in a hidden, but accessible area. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are made for one purpose, to sheild the general @CAPS3 of things that would be seen by the majority as obscene. These @CAPS2 are not out in the open where anyone can stumble upon them, they are usually in a corner of the @CAPS4, closed off, and marked '@CAPS1'. These @CAPS2 allow a little bit of compromise between the two sides of the debate for censorship, by still allowing all types of literature, but also sheilding anyone from seeing or hearing any of it unpurposefully. Because of these @CAPS2 there is no way anyone could complain about obscenity in the general @CAPS4 setting. For the libraries without @CAPS1 @CAPS2, there is the warning on the door of the @CAPS4, the word @CAPS3. @CAPS3 libraries are intended for the @CAPS3. Walking into one, under ones own power, dispells any complaints one would have about obscenity. This is because the act of entering a @CAPS3 @CAPS4, puts one in the atmosphere of the @CAPS4, whatever it @MONTH1 be. Libraries should not be held responsible for whether or not the literature on their shelves is offensive. The word @CAPS3 in the term @CAPS3 @CAPS4 is, like said previously, a warning of its own, letting anyone know who is entering that there is a chance there @MONTH1 be some things that person could precieve as obscene. This and multiple other reasons put to rest any thought one would have about removing certain literature from libraries. The three reasons given, along with the many more out there left unsaid, make it inevitable that libraries are not ment to be censored. The fact that the word obscene can not be tailored to fit everyone's personal views, the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and the word @CAPS3 placed infront of @CAPS4, warning everyone any type of literature could be in said @CAPS4, are enough to disspell any thought of censoring libraries. Underground bunkers were designed to sheild and censor the @CAPS3, not libraries.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 592:\n","Essay Text: Bad @CAPS1 Should censorship be Removed I think that they schould be taken off of the shelves in libraries.

Absolutely, there are many books, magazines, and music selections that should have never reached the shelf. Life has many choices. The people of this world have a choice on what they read or listen to. At a young age we are taught right from wrong. Everyone has different rights and many different wrongs, that they are taught by their parents. It is those morals we our taught that censorship help us decide what we should listen to or what we shoud read. I am a high school student that is very aware of right or wrong. Though my choices @MONTH1 not show as much. I am very aware of what I read and put into my head. Who wants to have certain magazine sex stories in their head? Not me, thats for sure! That makes any guy a perverse guy. I don't read books the tell me how to get in a girl's pants, that is wrong and I belive that should be censored. As a high school guy looking at a girl can be tough on some and then deciding to read about how to get a girl only encourages those types of attitudes. It is the exact same for girls too. Reading wrong stuff puts it into your head. What goes in your head comes out. Music is very influential in todays world. Rap for instence talks about money, sex, and drugs. Like I said garbage in is garbage out. Rap does have a good side too, all music does it is just an example. Then you have rockstars that do the exact same thing. All music depending on the genre you listen to, does say a lot about the person he/ or she is. Christen music does not need to be censored, because it is positive and up-lifting. Not all songs on the radio need to be censored either. Yes the ones talking about sex, drugs, and other terrible things need to be censored. Why would you want to put that stuff in your head? It makes no sense if that is who you want to be, a unintellegent person that no one likes, due to your moods. Movies could do without all the vulgar language and the sex scenes. Movies are meant to be enjoyed. Movies recently have not been family oriented. Transformers for example is a go out with your friends movie. The @CAPS1 series should never have been created. The person that made the @CAPS1 series has a very dark and twisted mind. Scary movies have a purpose for @CAPS3 and other festivities. Scary or not it should have less sex scenes. You should not have to worry what your child is going to see if he/ or she goes out to the movies with friends. Movies play a big part in our economy and that means many adults, teenagers, and children our watching something that is or is not good for their mind and well-being, but movies still have positive impact, jsut depends on what your watching. It is very obvious that our society has different views on, if things should be censored or not. People have their own lifes to lead and live, it is their right to decide what is right and what is wrong. Books, music, and movies influence our society in many ways. Yes some things need to be censored, because music and movies are making some things socially acceptable. When growing up not all things are socially acceptable, or so we are taught. Schools should not censor many books or our music selections, because it is high school it is when we discover ourselves. It is the morals that we are taught that define us, and what we learn from those morals of what is right or wrong to; read, listen to, or watch, that is what builds us as people to grow. You put garbage in your morals with what you do, you are only going to get garbage out\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 594:\n","Essay Text: During my freshman year there was a lot of controversy over whether or not the classes should be allowed to read 'The @ORGANIZATION1' in school. The debate was due to the fact that there is a rape scene in the book, which many people find too innappropriate for freshman to be reading about. However, it seems to me that we are exposed to offensive things every day and it is not plausible to simply censor every innappropriate censorship thing we come across. In terms of censorship in libraries, it is outlandish to think that we could do the same thing. When people visit libraries, they are there to check out books that they want to read. While there @MONTH1 be many forms of offensive media avaliable to the public through the library, that doesn't mean that people are obligated to view them. We are all perfectly capable of choosing for ourselves what we put into our minds. Because the media advertises offensive things all the time, we cannot block out everything. However we can chose what it is that we want to read when we visit the library. Since it is a choice, it shouldn't be necessary to censor everything there because you don't have to chose to view it. Censorship is also very subjective. What is deemed offensive to someone, @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else. If we oblige to sensor everything anyone claims to be offensive, there would no longer be any forms of media left. This is much like the quote from Katherine Paterson, where she says, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We rid the libraries of what each person finds offensive and what do you have left? Being around things we find offensive is, sadly, a part of life. That does not mean that we have engage in such things. It will never get to a point where everyone is completely happy with the way things are being censored unless everything is done away with, and that would only bring about new issues. We have to have the self control to provide censorship for ourselves, we cannot leave that job to other people.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 595:\n","Essay Text: I believe, an artist has the rights to his/her music being sold.

Like these qoutes '@CAPS1 are fat and lazy people.''@CAPS1 are border jumpers.''All @CAPS1 are good is farming and cleaning.' @CAPS5 on now, not all @CAPS1 are fat. Some of us have jobs and are tired from working long hours. We are not border jumpers. We have our passports/ green cards.All of these things are offensive and should be removed. I know other @CAPS1 get offended when they see this stuff. Let's say that you're @CAPS8 and you walk into the libray and you see a book all about jokes. You pick up the book and start looking through it and you @CAPS5 across a section about your race. The joke says 'All @CAPS9 are hillbillies.' '@CAPS10, how many @CAPS9 censorship does it take to clean up the house? None because they're dirty so way does it matter.' I know then you would want the library to remove that book. All I'm saying is that having offensive material in the libraries is wrong. They should remove those books, music, movies, and magazines when people complain about them. You wouldn't want your children asking you questions like 'Are we dirty @CAPS9 @CAPS13?' or ' @CAPS14 are we wetbacks?' So yes I believe that those things should be remove from the shelves.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 600:\n","Essay Text: Should we be censoring what people read in libraries? Absolutely! I believe we should, at least for the children. There are some pretty bad things out there that I do not believe are quite appropriate for children, or even teenagers. If I were a parent, there are many things I would not let my child read or look at. If we don't even give them a chance to see them, then we wouldn't have to worry. Chidren these day are not what they used to be. What would their great grandparents think if they saw the way today's adolescents act, dress, and even talk? Where do you think they get this from? The answer is simple. They get it from today's movies, books, music, and magazines. We cannot keep going on like this or eventually we will have toddlers acting inappropriately! I know from experience that when children are small and they see or hear something, it sticks with them for a long time. If child is looking through a magazine and they see a questionable picture, they are not likely to forget that picture very soon. Or if they are listening to a song with bad words, don't be surprised if they do not forget them or even start repeating them. That is just how small children are. My last point is the fact that parents would probably be much happier if offensive material censorship was removed from libraries. Parents would be able to bring their children to the library and not have to worry about what they are looking at or listening to. The children would feel a sense of freedom and the parents would, in return, feel a sense of reassurance. Offensive material should definitely be removed from our libraries in order to keep our children pure and their parents happy. I understand that others would argue that if we take out offensive material then eventually, there would be nothing left for our children to read. Well, obviously not everything can be censored, but I think a lot of it should be. Censoring material in libraries is definitely the way to go, not just for our children, but also our teenagers\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 601:\n","Essay Text: Libraries @CAPS1 we would do without books?

I peronally agree with the author Katherine Paterson, she thought many censorship books were offensive to the audiance, but if someone had the power to remove a book from the shelfs, that made everyone to have this power, and @CAPS1 would we have left? We would loose very important information of our lifes and our ancestors. People have different taste, fellings, thoughts.

I do not believe books that some people find offensive should not be taken of shelfs, because they @MONTH1 not be offensive to other people. Books should be seperated by reading levels in libraries. Having a kid, teen and adult section, will help organize a library. This will make it much easier for children to find books that they can actually read. Also if children books are seperated of adult books parents wont find any book offencive to their children. Having books organized by reading levels will make life much easier for censorship a person looking for a certin reading level. Music should be put in to certin catorgies such as rock, jazz, rap or country. Childrens music should be in the kids section along with the books, magazines and movies. Doing this for the children will keep them away from unappriate music, books, maganzies and movies. The music section should not have any bad language in the music that they allow to be checked out. If anyone considered any of the music in the library offensive the library should remove it. Movies should also be seprated by age levels. G, @CAPS2, @NUM1, and @CAPS3 should be the catorgies that the movies should be put into. The only exception should be the childrens movies which should be put into the children section. No one should be allowed to check out a book unless the are old enough for the catorgie they are checking out. This is my view on how libraries should be set up. I think by doing this it would keeps the younger children away from books that might be offensive to them.

These meterials could consist of nude pictures and so on. Most parents do not want to see there kids getting a hold of this type of material. You maybe think 'what could we do about this things, or least come to a compermise to make almost everyone happy. I have so reasons why we should put this type of material away from kids sight and reach. First of all, the books and magizines that have any nude in them, should have their own section and, be labled aduts only. I know this might be alot of work but it is needed, so kids aren't aloud to go in ths section. This will help ruduce what little kids see. There are also books and magizines that are offensive to children of a different race. These books should be removed from the shelves also because they hert peoples feelings, and this might make customers leave your libary. I am not saying ouhae to take ever single book of your selves, but a least reduce the number of books of your selves out of kids eyes mostly and some adults if they are offended. Next thing that comes to mind is the music on compacked discs, or cd's which ever you perfere. In this day and age there are alot of musicians out there that have alot of bad words in their songs. These songs; are songs parents dont like there children to listen to, because parents are afraid of their children here these words and repeating them at home. These type of cd's should be taken of shelves where kids are, and put in a section also labled adults only. I know this the wont stop kids from hearing these words and say them, but at least the parents can blame you for their child saying these words, because you did the smart thing and put these cd's out of kids reach. There are songs that are ofensive to people but i know you cant go throught every song and take them off the shelves, but a least take the cd's off the shelve that you know are offensive to people. The last that comes to mind that should be taken off the shelves that are material children shouldnt see is the movies. There are movies out there that are to graphic, to vilent, and to much nudity that kids dont need to see. These type of movies need to also get a section that is for adults only. Then you have the movies that need to just be taking off the shelve because they are to offensive to some viewers. I know that you @MONTH1 say but if it is offensive to them, they dont have to get it. This maybe true but a least move the to a section that those people that get offended dont go. Those were my thoughts on what should be done with material thats to offensive and not aprobriet for eyes or minds.These might be a little extreme but i hope you at least take some of these things into consideration. You cant please all but you can try.

When you enter a library, you don't want to see something that is very offensive. For example, one time my friend and I walked in to the library and the first thing we saw was a book about inappropiate things. We were young so that was the last thing we wanted to see.

People need to know what happened in the past so they can move on in the future.

These books that are found offensive to some @MONTH1 not be offensive to others, heres an example, lets say there is a recovering alcoholic and this person is flipping through a magazine and they see a alcoholic beverage ad in the magazine.

I went to the computers to see if my favorite book available. The computer showed that the book was taken off the shelf for offending readers. I checked another list that listed numerous books, music, movies, and magazines that were also taken off of the shelves. Half of the list, I had checked out already. The librarian said the council is voting to take or not take specific books, music, movies, and other items off of the shelves for offensive content. As a regular library customer, I felt I needed to express my opinion of the topic. I believe that before these materials are taken off of the shelves that the librarians need to consider an age limit, a 'three strikes your out' rule, or how much these materials mean to people. Offending people is not what these materials are meant to do. Some books can be perceived in that way which makes the readers angry. I can understand someone's feelings being hurt by a certain topic of reading, but that person @MONTH1 not be mature enough to comprehend what the book is intending as a message. My sister who is the age of ten has read a book which offended her, but she also didn't know what the book really was about. I believe that anyone the age of sixteen or older should be allowed access to these books, music, movies, and magazines. Age sixteeen is when most people are already in high school and more mature. Anyone younger than that shouldn't be allowed access to these items. If the readers are mature enough to handle the material, then people @MONTH1 not be offended as much. Another new rule the library could try is the 'three strikes you're out rule.' @CAPS1 rule is when someone behaves inappropriately. Some people who behave inappropriately will tell everyone the book is offensive and make up stories about the book so their friends will laugh. Each person receives a strike every time they behave inappropriately. @CAPS1 includes in a school classroom as well as the library. After a certain amount of strikes, that person wouldn't be allowed to check out the material. The librarians could keep a record of @CAPS1 which could be accessed whenever. Even if the person is of age to check out the material, they couldn't do so if they had a certain amount of strikes on their record. These materials mean a great deal to people. I am an avid reader as well as movie watcher. When I read a book, I feel like I have freedom. No one is telling me I perceive the book wrong, or that isn't the what the character would look like. Reading a book is my own imagination making up the pictures of the story in my head. Taking these items off of the shelves takes away people's immagination. It also takes away from the writers freedom of speech in the @CAPS2 of @CAPS3. The writers wrote their book under that @CAPS2 and now there freedom is basically being taken away from them by taking there speech off of shelves. Overall, I believe that these materials shouldn't be taken off of the shelves. The librarians should consider either making up new rules or thinking about people's opinions of the subject. The librarians should also consider the freedom of speech rule when they are taking these materials off of the shelves. If they don't consider any of these options, then all offensive materials would be taken away. One person could say a book or movie is offensive and it would be taken off of the shelf. After awhile, the library would eventually become empty.

There is no reason to tarnish anyone elses reading, listening, or watching anything of their interest because others find it offensive.

When you walk into a library usually the first thing you see are magazines. There can be some pretty inapropriate magazines with inapropriate covers. Is this really what you want people looking at? Especially young kids? There are also movies at a library. Yes, most of them are old movies, but some of them are also kids movies. What if one of those old movies had a bad cover on it, or bad language? A lot of movies are also offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3. I think this because, back in the old days there was a lot of racism, and that is still in alot of movies now. There could also be movies against someones religion. That could be very offensive to certain people. Most of this stuff in libraries can be offensive to young kids because of the covers. Some can be offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because of racism. I think that if you have a problem with something that you see on a shelf, you should tell the librarian and see if they will take it off the shelf. You shouldn't have to be offended by something at the library. I think that people should have their rights to get certain materials off of the shelf. Especially if they think it's offensive to them, or anybody else that might happen to see the same thing. Is this really what we want in our libraries is offensive materials? Just remember to think about what you put on the shelves at your public library\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 613:\n","Essay Text: I think books, movies or magazines should be aloud in libraries.

And why somethings do not need to be sensored at the library. I will help you to understand what young teenagers or younger children should and should not be able to see or borrow from the library. There are somethings that should be kept from the kids eyes. What are some of the movies, books, or magazines that should be hidden from children? This is probably what you are woundering. The first thing that kids should not be allowed to borrow would be movies that have any that is over there age requirement to see at the movie theather. The reason this is so that the teenager or young child does not watch anything that @MONTH1 scary them. Another thing that should not be seen would be the the movies that are meant for a mature veiwer meaning an adult viewer. There are a few books that kids should not be able to read until they are an adult. And these books would be the ones that have a harsh backround on past events that happened. Like what happen during a war to a captured soldier or a prisoner of war. And what they to go through during their imprisonment. These are the books that should be hidden from younger childern. There are some movies, books, music, magazines that do not need to be sensored for people to see. Starting with why some movie do not need to be sensored. First is because most movies are funny but have just a little need of maturity. These movies are the ones that have alot of comedy and as most adults know most kids are into the funny movies. So why take away a movie that is something a kid would have a great time watching. There are some books that should probably be read by adults but there are some teenagers that are mature enough to read this stories. Or if they need to learn about a specific topic for school work they should be allowed to read that book. I do not think that any genre or group of music should be sensored. This because music is a way for someone to express themselves without even having to truely say anything. about who they are or what kind of a mood they are in. music does much more then just that though it helps some people vent on there anger or even how sad they @MONTH1 be. But in conclusion I think there are many things that are good but still need to be sensored for most of the young childern and teenagers to be able to see. And on the other hand there are alot of good things that do not need to be sensored like music and book and even certain magazines.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 616:\n","Essay Text: Dear Newspaper, I believe that everyone in our town should have the same right to check out books, music, movies ect.

I believe they should allow these certain category of books, movies, and magazines to be allowed, however to an extent. Libraries should open up an area for people above the age of @NUM1 to view this material with a special membership. Books and magazines in libraries are, and should be seperated by categories. The books and magazines that could be considered 'highly offensive,' do not belong on the library shelves at all. However, books and magazines that give out informative data with proper conduct should be allowed. If libraries create an area in which peoples' prefrences are to view content over the age of @NUM1, they should be required to have their own membership. In order to even look at material that is uncensored, visitors need a special pass; this way people who get offended by material that is not censored do not have to pass it while inside the library. Many people who do not want to go out and spend @MONEY1 on a movie rental like to go to the library. Libraries should allow movies from the ranges of ratings @CAPS1(@CAPS2) to @CAPS3(@CAPS4) to be on the shelves of the library. Going into a public library should not have any more restrictions that going into a public video store. However, videos that are considered 'pornography,' should not be in any part of the library. Just like in a public video store, libraries should not contain any footage that is considered pornography. Much of the popular music today is considered offensive. The music in libraries can still be the same songs, but they need to have clean content in them. I believe that edited music in libraries is okay the under any circumstances. I do not believe that explicit music is okay. People inside the library could be listening to this explicit music before they take it home, while others in the library get offended by it. People overhearing music would not happen often, but we need to make sure it does not happen at all. Overall, material in libraries that could be considered offensive should not be allowed to be viewed except under special memberships that have proof that an individual is over the age of @NUM1. We all need to work together to make sure our libraries stay clean and unoffensive.

As little kids we all were tought to pick up a book and read but as we get older we fall off, but what people do not know is, books help develop your reading and vocabulary skills.

That would make someone who really like the book that they took alway upset. Libraries are suppose to have books that everyone can read and learn from, so if they don't have books for everyone the library should'nt be there. I disagree with removing certain material from the library and here is why. First, the reason why i the would'nt remove certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc., because the library is a place where people come to learn about new things. Just because one person does'nt like the book does'nt make it right for them to remove it. If people don't wont their children to read the book don't let them go to the library. They go buy their child some good books to read. Also, no one would want to go to a library that does'nt have what they are looking for. That would'nt be a good look for the library, because if someone goes there and find that all the books their looking for is not in and this is the only library in town they would never want to go back there again. Then they would tell moe people about how that library does'nt have anything your looking for in it. Then, the library would get old close down then get knocked down, and in the shot were the library use to be would be a mini mall, food store, ect. so i really don't think it's a good idea to take book off the shelves at the libraries. We need those books because you never know when something can come up and you need that one book that is not there. In conclusion, removing books from the shelves is a bad thing to do.

Kid's reading offensive things the and seeing offensive things will hurt them due to them still learning basic things in life. Once when I was little, I picked up and read a book about drugs and sex. They talked about how they feel, where you can get them from, and what they looked like. For a minor reading on how to get drugs and use them, that's telling them to much. It is not a good thing to tell kid's so early in their life about drugs because, they are going to get curious about how the drugs feel. When I was told about drugs I was very curious and I wanted to learn more about them. The older and boring we become the more we will want to try the drugs we learned about earlier in our lives. More people every day try drugs because there is nothing else to do. When I learned about sex while being a kid made me want to try it because they made it sound good in books. Being teached offensive things in libraries is a bad thing because, who would think something bad could be in a library? You go to the library to learn good things about life and if their are offensive things in books and in writing you will pick them bad things up in your life.

Everyone has different interests. People @MONTH1 read one specific type of book and only that type. Others will read all types. Some people @MONTH1 think that books are too scary, violent, or sexual. Others @MONTH1 enjoy the thrill in them and want to read these books. There are many ways in which a book could be inappropriate. This, however, does not mean libraries should have censorship. Libraries should have sections that are age appropriate. That way if a book is too bad in some way then the mature audience would read it and an audience that should be reading children's books would not be in that section. Another reason they should not be allowed to take books off of shelves is because it's disrespectful to the author. The author took a long time creating their book aimed towards a specific audience. For someone to take it off a shelf and ruin peoples chances for being able to read that is awful and it should not be allowed.

And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' -@ORGANIZATION1 quote moves mountians with its wisdom. In @ORGANIZATION1 day and age, many of the things we read/see in magazines, movies, the news etc. are considered to be quite offensive to many. Would a mother of a fifteen year old be upset if @CAPS5 found her daughter reading a magazine that stated, 'safe sex is great sex', or a father finding his teenage son watching a movie with pornographic scenes? The answer is no. The magazines, movies, music and books that are being sent out into libraries all over the world are not exactly '@CAPS1 rated' and many adults would be shocked to realize exactly what it is teenagers are viewing; but is it right to then remove everything some one finds to be wrong or offensive? Lets think about religion for a second. Atheists would find the bible to be a lie, maybe even find it offensive. So in turn to be considerate of their beliefs does that make it 'right' to remove the bible from libraries and open access to the public? Think about the novel, 'To @CAPS2 a @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. English scholars around the world will state that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a novel of its time; that it will continue to be read hundreds of years from now at schools around the world. Some though, would find @ORGANIZATION1 book offensive. The word 'nigger' is placed in @ORGANIZATION1 novel many times and is set in a time when slavery is not frowned apon. Just because one parent finds @ORGANIZATION1 book to be offensive does that mean students from all over should no longer be allowed to read it; that @ORGANIZATION1 book should be 'removed from the shelves?' The questions posed here are not simple questions, they require much time and thought. If a survey was posted asking: Should certain materials be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? The outcome would be intangible to think about now, considering people have many different views on the aspect. In reading @ORGANIZATION1 and contemplating the questions asked you will realize that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a black or white concept; there lies a large area of grey in the middle. Something that one @MONTH1 find offensive, another would not; something a teenager views as interesting an adult @MONTH1 view as crude or vulger. Does @ORGANIZATION1 mean that everything would be taken down from the shelves then? Yes. In the quote above by Katherine Paterson, @CAPS5 states, '.. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS5 is correct in @ORGANIZATION1 because @CAPS5 realizes that everyone has different views on what is appropriate or not. @ORGANIZATION1 statement shows that although libraries @MONTH1 allow inappropriate the novels, magazines, tapes etc. to be open to the easy access of customers there is no way that they would be able to make everyone feel content without completely wiping out the building of its contents. The right to take a book away also is a right to leave it; leave the books then and let the ones who enjoy them, simply enjoy.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 626:\n","Essay Text: We have all read a the book or heard a song that has offended us or just didn't catch our intrest, right?

Children don't think on the same track that most adults do, and therefore are incapable of handling certain knowledges that adults have long since known and otherwise dealt with. Those who know of the consequences of certain knowledges in the wrong minds have tried to keep the information from those who can't or shouldn't worry about them untill they're older and more capable of understanding what it all means. A lot of ideas we have @DATE1, from science and technology, from philosophical thinking to common sense, most everything has been written down in the past, or is being written @DATE1. That's where the problems arise. Almost everything is written about or recorded in some way, therefore increasing the chances that someone will hear or see this knowledge and, not knowing it's importance, might even abuse it eventually. Think about the crimes that go on @DATE1. Are all of them simple? Do they all focus on the same things? How do they come about? All these questions are able to be answered in the simplest ways; the people who commited them learned about something too early in life and grew up thinking it was ok, whether they learned it from books, or music, or movies, etc., and eventually repeated these things they learned. Of course that's not always the case, but for those people who don't know why so many people ended up as the people who get thrown into jail, or get into trouble, a major factor is what they learn at an early age, and not having sensible people to help them to know what's right and what's wrong. To conclude, I think the best ways to avoid the wrong information getting into the wrong hands, is to have censorship in libraries. Without it, people can just walk up to any shelf and pick up that one book, even a nine-year-old child.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 630:\n","Essay Text: Some books, music, movies, and magazines or other types of information or entertanment are innapropriate. I dont believe that they should be removed from the library or other puplic places for that reason though. You have to take a lot into conciteration before decideing weather it should be censored or not. Age is one aspect. If the material is not sutable to a sertain age then it should be organized into a different age category according to the library. I believe that there should be age limits like the ones they have on movies or video games. Rescently there was a book, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, that was questioned on the use of language in it. I think that the author wrote their book the way they want it and would like it sold that way not have it censored. If you find something offensive that doesen't mean you should keep getting involved with it. If there is a book or movie that is offfensive to you, you can stop reading or stop watching it at your own will. Often on the radio there are songs the that use innapropriate language and it is bleeped out. Why should we bleep it? Some people could find it more offensive to hear it bleeped than to hear the words just said. And thier oppinion should be the one that counts. The questin weather there should be censorship in libraries is all about a persons perspecitve. Someone is always going to see it differently than you. There is nothing bad about that. I remember watching a show one time and there were these characters in a book club and they were debateing the book its self. Not always is everyone going to like your oppinion of something but you shouldn't despise people for that. I believe that the libraries should not have to use censorship when we have lived as humans long enough to be able to make a decision for ourselves. We should stop being told what to do by rules and laws all the time and have our oppinions heard.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 631:\n","Essay Text: I believe that our libraries should stay the same as they have always been.

I never even heard of a problem in the libraries about things offending people before but sometimes people just need to grow up. There's a certain point to where yeah things should not be writen or films that should'nt have been made but if you dont like it, then dont read it and or watch it. People all have a right to the libraries. Nobody forces anyone to read or watch something, its by the readers choice. Theres no sence in ruining many peoples enjoyment just because a selected few people dont like something. Thats like the @ORGANIZATION2 not having any football just because the players feel like they dont get payed enough @MONEY1 to play it. Taking books and magazines off the library shelves is like the @ORGANIZATION2 locking out everything. Just because a few people arent happy, doesnt mean that everything should be taking out so others cant enjoy the it. Why even have a library if your going to change everything because people get offended. Is @ORGANIZATION1 going to stop carrying penuts because some people are allergic to them? No. If people dont like something they have the choice to buy or take it if they want to or not. Its a simple fact that some things should just be left alone. People are all different. Its going to take a long time for people to figure that out. In fact, people @MONTH1 never figure that out. So in my opionion I believe that the libraries can carry anything they want as long as it is appropreit. My thinking is that it will be best if we keep libraries the way they are. In the end, more people will be unhappy of a change than the happier it makes people after the change. in other words the numbers of people who are happy with the change will be out weighed greatly with the people who are unhappy.

Imagine a little girl about the age of four walking through differnce sections of books in a library when she finds a book that cacthes her eye in the adult section. The book is baby blue and has a little bird on it. However, the book also has a half naked man on cover besided the cute little bird. The girl grabs the book and goes happly to find her mom. When the mom looks at the book her face is in shock. What would you do if that was your daughter? Most likely we'd put the book back and explain why she can't have it. While, others would go screaming to the check out and asking, 'how is it possible that my daughter got this? Shouldn't the libraries be wacthing the the kids to make sure they don't go in that section?'. I believe that certain materials, such as books,movies, ect., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact people will still find way to get the removed material and that it's just a part of life. My first reason that certain materials, such as books, shouldn't be pulled from are shelves is that we live in a nation that prides it's self as the '@CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. That doesn't mean we get everything for @CAPS2 when we go to a store it just simple means that you, the people of @LOCATION1, have the freedom and right to speak your mind. So you can say whatever you want in newspapers or in books because the government gives you that right. However, you can't say 'I have a bomb' at the airports because of the many attacks the nation has encountered over the years, but that's common sences. My second reason that certain materials should say on the put, even if someone is offened by it is that no matter how many books or movies you take of the store shelves, the people will find a way to get them. One way to get them is the black market where people sell drugs and weapons. Do we, as a country really need another drug on the market even if it's a book? I think not. Also, if you look at the whole picture people will be losing jobs because the televison today is not the kind they had back in your grandma's day. Nearly @PERCENT1 of everything on televison has something to do with the little three letter s-word every parent hates to talk about. You might be thinking that if we take the unrated movies and the books with the naked men on the cover we'd be saving are children which leads me to my last point. Seeing unrated movies and such is a part of life. So what are you saving them from? Children sooner or later will grow up and learn about the types of subject matter so why take it off when you will have to teach them about it sooner rather then later? Millions of parents around the @CAPS3 each and every year have to teach their kids about the birds and the bees. It's a part of growing up in a way. Now a days though, the birds and the bees are all people seem to talk about. So like it or not your kids will find out just like you did and your parents before you. Plus, your not going to make everyone happy. Someone will always be offened by something. Imagine. Imagine that same little girl, now an adult, having to deal with that same issue of the same baby blue book with the same little bird with the half naked man on the cover. The truth is that this way my mother when she was little and it turns out that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree because I had the same issue as well. I know that one day I will also have the same issue as my mother did before me. So I believe that certain materials, such as books and movies, shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact that people will still find a way to get the removed material and that it's just apart of life.

The media should be for everyone to enjoy and not have to worry about offensive material. In @DATE1's world there are offensive media out there and they often start up problems. We need to do something about this problem. If there are offensive media out there the kids of the future are going to look up to them and try to be like them or hate the same thing that the media does. Let's just say there was a song about school and how people dont like it don't you think our the kids are going to hate school too? I don't think that is right. We need to teach our kids that school is very important and not to take in what the media says because they are not always right. We want enjoyable media in the world.

If a book talks about how bad a certain race is those people that were disliked in the book are going to get even with the people who made the book or other media. Many issues @DATE1 are over media out there in the world. People that work at libraries should keep an eye out for offensive materals and shoud remove them to prevent even more problems. I'm sure libraries all around the world have some kind of offensive media in it. We need to stand up and fight to get rid of all offensive media and make the world a better place.

Truth be told, there are many ways for our offspring to not have the availability of those books. There is what I believe to be an appropriate division on the materials in our libraries and bookstores, the fact that we can always monitor what our children read and watch, and not to mention that we can use the internet to back up any doubts we have on the literature and lyrics.The question that remains is: Are we using the ways of preventing this problem to the best of our abilities? I believe that our public libraries and bookstores do a splendid job of diviying up what is deemed appropriate for each age group. Teens know a fairly good amount more about things than all parents invision they shouldn't, and I think the bookstores and libraries keep the youths knowledge in what they're listening, watching, and reading to what these kids already know. Comparing what is considered a 'young adult' book and an 'adult' book, you will find an atrocious difference. Young adult books only hint around things such as drugs, refraining from abstinence, and grisly murder scenes whereas adult books go into a great deal more detail. Middle school level children's books are even more less detailed than teen books, so it is save to say that as long as the parents are directing their child into the appropriate section in anyone's given local library, they will be in good hands. There's also the option of monitering what our young ones are listening to. By simply being interested in what it is that the child is singing or humming along to, us parents would find that they wouldn't be reluctant to let on about what was being said. If in any case we feel that the lyrics are too harsh for the kid, we are still their parents and have the right to deem it as something they shouldn't be listening to and suggest something different to them and/or ban them from being able to listen. In @CAPS1 cases though, we should try to listen to what our kids are. In this way, we can be reassured that the range of materials they're plugging into their ears are not what we would consider to be grotesque for something our children's age. the Another useful tool would have to be the internet. If we don't feel the need to ask about the literature or music, but @MONTH1 still have a few doubts, there are plenty of book and music blogs across the world wide web that can help us out. Even by going to a bookstore website and reading the description about the book, or a lyric website that will tell us what is being said, or even a movie website where we can see a rating and the content of the movie, and the comments left by people that go with it respectively, @CAPS1 of us would find all of the information we need. Even author's, director's, and artist's websites would be useful. Looking at their discussions would be a big help as well, considering that @CAPS1 of these people have a vision of what age groups would be attracted to their material. In conclusion, I think our children are fairly wise about what they choose to read, listen to, and watch, but then again, it all depends on the preference. Not every child is the same, just as not any adult, or any one person. The prefernce tends to lean towards the things we think are appropriate. Paying attention to what the young ones are like says alot about what they read, and what they listen to and watch, for that matter. We have all these ways of keeping our children from reading, watching and listening to inappropriate things, we just have to make them and asset\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 636:\n","Essay Text: For many years libraries have had books, magazines, and movies posted in their shelves of the library that are very offensive to many people. Many people ask how is it ok for that material to be open to teenagers and possibly children. In my opinion I think that it is not right for libraries not to do anything about this problem, especially when this is happening across the nation. In large department stores such as @ORGANIZATION1, you are required to be eighteen years old to purchase adult items, sometimes you must be twenty-one years of age. It is considered illegal for anyone under the required age to purchase an item with an age limit on it. Music is a totally different type of profanity, @CAPS1 albums are sold with much innapropiate material in them that is open to the public, but the @CAPS1's sold in stores are usually edited into a more appropiate version. Days like today nearly no one ever buys @CAPS1's anymore, its all about @CAPS4's and @NUM1's where all you have to do is find your song on a site and download it for free in about four to five seconds. It would not surprise me if libraries had music and @CAPS1's with just as much adult profanity, and language that is not edited out. So if most of the things in this world that are adult rated and can not be purchased unless your considered an adult by age, why should it be ok to viewed by any age in a library. I myself believe that it should be illegal for materials such as the ones mentioned to be banned or atleast taken more respected with the viewer of the materials. It would really hurt a parent for them to take a kid to a library and tell them to go find a book they like, and they return to their mother or father with an adult book with many things a child or possibly a teenager should not see. I believe times like those could tear a parent or even a grandparent apart, having to explain to their children or grandchildren what they just saw. Because most of us know that most children always want to know what something is when they see it, and for a parent to have to explain to their child at that age has to be heart-stopping. In all of this that I have explained is only my opinion, but I believe many other millions of people agree with me. If it is not aloud almost everywhere else in this world, why should it be ok a library to do it? Is it because its some little rule about freedom of decision? Do libraries think just because they are old fashioned and have been here longer than the @CAPS1's, @CAPS4's, and @NUM1's that they dont have to follow rules and guidelines. It is a shame that they are ruining the lives the and visions of the children and teens today to think its ok for anyone to see, listen, or watch these materials.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 637:\n","Essay Text: There are many books in the libraries.

I say no that the books, music, movies, or magazines should not be removed from libraries, because if the books or etc. are that offensive, those things shouldn't be in childrens reach anyway. There should be a section limit where children can't go by to get to the offensive type books and others. Why take things that older people would insist on looking at off the the shelf just because someone didn't separate the adult books and etc., from the childrens. Taking away the things that adults look at would be just as bad as taking the things that children or teens would like such as the music and movies, even though the music sometimes influnce some children to do bad or get off track from being who they really are. I don't understand why take those type things down when you are getting benefits off the things that people buy that will help keep libraries open such as fun rasier type. If you don't have things in a library that will capture a young persons attention like the movies, music, or magazines then children or teens will not be interested on going to libraries. Adults nor teens will sit in a library with under age books, movies, or music. Reason being is, becuase they are muture and not exactly looking for a book with lots of pictures and cartoons unless they are reading to an under age sibling. When that child has to go to library with his or her parent for example to do a project that parent would rather not just sit and wait the whole time for his or her child to finish.

When I sit down to read a book or magazine, or to watch a movie, I want to read or watch an interesting story.

There are just to many views on what is explicit to discern between what should be allowed, and what should be expunged. In many cases libraries have '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' in which books, that the majority of people would consider explicit, are held. These @CAPS2 are normally closed off and a person has to exert some sort of physical motion through a barrier in order to enter, therefore they are in full knowledge that there @MONTH1 be offensive literature there. One also must take into account the meaning of the term '@CAPS3 @CAPS4'. That term has a key phrase in the title, @CAPS3, which is almost a warning in itself that the literature in it @MONTH1 be offensive to someone. These points show that there should be no restriction on the books, magazines or music in @CAPS3 libraries. The first topic of discussion is the definition of obscene. There are @NUM1 billion people, in the @LOCATION1 alone, that all have their own views of what they consider obscene to be. If one asked an avid conservative their thoughts on obscenity, they would differ by a tremendous amount of those that a free-spirited individual would have. The inconsistency of views is an obvious reason to keep all types of books in libraries. Not only that but also the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 allows libraries to put grossly obscene literature in a hidden, but accessible area. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are made for one purpose, to sheild the general @CAPS3 of things that would be seen by the majority as obscene. These @CAPS2 are not out in the open where anyone can stumble upon them, they are usually in a corner of the @CAPS4, closed off, and marked '@CAPS1'. These @CAPS2 allow a little bit of compromise between the two sides of the debate for the censorship, by still allowing all types of literature, but also sheilding anyone from seeing or hearing any of it unpurposefully. Because of these @CAPS2 there is no way anyone could complain about obscenity in the general @CAPS4 setting. For the libraries without @CAPS1 @CAPS2, there is the warning on the door of the @CAPS4, the word @CAPS3. @CAPS3 libraries are intended for the @CAPS3. Walking into one, under ones own power, dispells any complaints one would have about obscenity. This is because the act of entering a @CAPS3 @CAPS4, puts one in the atmosphere of the @CAPS4, whatever it @MONTH1 be. Libraries should not be held responsible for whether or not the literature on their shelves is offensive. The word @CAPS3 in the term @CAPS3 @CAPS4 is, like said previously, a warning of its own, letting anyone know who is entering that there is a chance there @MONTH1 be some things that person could precieve as obscene. This and multiple other reasons put to rest any thought one would have about removing certain literature from libraries. The three reasons given, along with the many more out there left unsaid, make it inevitable that libraries are not ment to be censored. The fact that the word obscene can not be tailored to fit everyone's personal views, the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and the word @CAPS3 placed infront of @CAPS4, warning everyone any type of literature could be in said @CAPS4, are enough to disspell any thought of censoring libraries. Underground bunkers were designed to sheild and censor the @CAPS3, not libraries.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 642:\n","Essay Text: Bad @CAPS1 Should be Removed I think that they schould be taken off of the shelves in the libraries. I am going to tell you why I think they should be taken off of the sheleves. I am also going to tell about one of my personal experiences with something like this. The reason I think @CAPS1 like this should be taken off of the shelves, is because of little kids coming in and taking them off of the shelves and looking at @CAPS1, that aren't apporate for little childern to see. And older kids looking at them and getting some ideas from them and going home and doing them. Which could cause harm of even death. A personal experience with something like this when I was in fourth grade. Is I went to my teachers bookshelf and picked out a book to take home. That night when I got home I asked my mom if she colud read it to me before I went to bed. So she did and when she opened the book it had alot of bad words in it. That are bad for little childeren to hear. So she to it to the principal the next day and showed it to him and he fired the teacher for having the book on the shelves. Those are both good reasons why @CAPS1 like that schould be on book shelves. They can teach alot of bad @CAPS1 and get people in alot of trouble.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 643:\n","Essay Text: Should certain things in life be censored? Absolutely, there are many books, magazines, and music selections that should have never reached the shelf. Life has many choices. The people of this world have a choice on what they read or listen to. At a young age we are taught right from wrong. Everyone has different rights and many different wrongs, that they are taught by their parents. It is those morals we our taught that help us decide what we should listen to or what we shoud read. I am a high school student that is very aware of right or wrong. Though my choices @MONTH1 not show as much. I am very aware of what I read and put into my head. Who wants to have certain magazine sex stories in their head? Not me, thats for sure! That makes any guy a perverse guy. I don't read books the tell me how to get in a girl's pants, that is wrong and I belive that should be censored. As a high school guy looking at a girl can be tough on some and then deciding to read about how to get a girl only encourages those types of attitudes. It is the exact same for girls too. Reading wrong stuff puts it into your head. What goes in your head comes out. Music is very influential in todays world. Rap for instence talks about money, sex, and drugs. Like I said garbage in is garbage out. Rap does have a good side too, all music does the it is just an example. Then you have rockstars that do the exact same thing. All music depending on the genre you listen to, does say a lot about the person he/ or she is. Christen music does not need to be censored, because it is positive and up-lifting. Not all songs on the radio need to be censored either. Yes the ones talking about sex, drugs, and other terrible things need to be censored. Why would you want to put that stuff in your head? It makes no sense if that is who you want to be, a unintellegent person that no one likes, due to your moods. Movies could do without all the vulgar language and the sex scenes. Movies are meant to be enjoyed. Movies recently have not been family oriented. Transformers for example is a go out with your friends movie. The @CAPS1 series should never have been created. The person that made the @CAPS1 series has a very dark and twisted mind. Scary movies have a purpose for @CAPS3 and other festivities. Scary or not it should have less sex scenes. You should not have to worry what your child is going to see if he/ or she goes out to the movies with friends. Movies play a big part in our economy and that means many adults, teenagers, and children our watching something that is or is not good for their mind and well-being, but movies still have positive impact, jsut depends on what your watching. It is very obvious that our society has different views on, if things should be censored or not. People have their own lifes to lead and live, it is their right to decide what is right and what is wrong. Books, music, and movies influence our society in many ways. Yes some things need to be censored, because music and movies are making some things socially acceptable. When growing up not all things are socially acceptable, or so we are taught. Schools should not censor many books or our music selections, because it is high school it is when we discover ourselves. It is the morals that we are taught that define us, and what we learn from those morals of what is right or wrong to; read, listen to, or watch, that is what builds us as people to grow. You put garbage in your morals with what you do, you are only going to get garbage out\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 644:\n","Essay Text: During my freshman year there was a lot of controversy over whether or not the classes should be allowed to read 'The @ORGANIZATION1' in school. The debate was due to the fact that there is a rape scene in the book, which many people find too innappropriate for freshman to be reading about. However, it seems to me that we are exposed to offensive things every day and it is not plausible to simply censor every innappropriate thing we come across. In terms of censorship in libraries, it is outlandish to think that we could do the same thing. When people visit libraries, they are there to check out books that they want to read. While there @MONTH1 be many forms of offensive media avaliable to the public through the library, that doesn't mean that people are obligated to view them. We are all perfectly capable of choosing for ourselves what we put into our minds. Because the media advertises offensive things all the time, we cannot block out everything. However we can chose what it is that we want to read when we visit the library. Since it is a choice, it shouldn't be necessary to censor everything there because you don't have to chose to view it. Censorship is also very subjective. What is deemed offensive to someone, @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else. If we oblige to sensor everything anyone claims to be offensive, there would no longer be any forms of media left. This is much like the quote the from Katherine Paterson, where she says, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We rid the libraries of what each person finds offensive and what do you have left? Being around things we find offensive is, sadly, a part of life. That does not mean that we have engage in such things. It will never get to a point where everyone is completely happy with the way things are being censored unless everything is done away with, and that would only bring about new issues. We have to have the self control to provide censorship for ourselves, we cannot leave that job to other people.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 645:\n","Essay Text: I believe, an artist has the rights to his/her music being sold.

No I think not. The point is the choices made now is what is going to effect you in the long run. I really think its choice.

It all just depends on what the people in the library like. Taking a library book off of the shelf might be inappropriate for younger kids can kind of be wrong. Just for the simple fact that it @MONTH1 not be inappropriate for adults and it could be something that they would like to read.

My mother had seen a magazine that had said, '@CAPS1! To @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4!' I dont think they should take things like that away because it could be something someone wants to read. If a child sees it then the parent was not paying that good of attention to them. @CAPS3 can be prevented to where it is not a problem.

Someone a little bit older then me picked up the book and checked it out, my mom said you can read that when you get older just not right for your age. So I listened to her and I understand why but do not take it off the shelf, no reason to. There are ways to make sure inappropriate books do not get into childrens hands.

The people that do like the the action or humor or romance books would probably be upset @CAPS3 they took them away.Its also not fair because @CAPS3 takes away what they actually come to the library for in the first place. People that are offended by things always have other places to go to find books and movies and things like that. Not everybody has money to spend on movies. The library is a great place to barrow free movies and books and magazines if you cant afford to buy any. My family didnt have mony to buy any movies so we would go straight to the library to get free ones. Movies now days are very expinsive to jus be buying all the time. In the long run those movie cost are going to add up. Removing everything offensive would really limit the good choices in the library. If you are just left with all the boaring material nobody will come but the ones who got offended. People want the good stuff thats why majority of the folks go.

Having material that is offensive to people in libraries is just plain wrong. The reason I believe that libraries should remove offensive material because, I always see books and movies that are racist toward @CAPS1. Like these qoutes '@CAPS1 are fat and lazy people.''@CAPS1 are border jumpers.''All @CAPS1 are good is farming and cleaning.' @CAPS5 on now, not all @CAPS1 are fat. Some of us have jobs and are tired from working long hours. We are not border jumpers. We have our passports/ green cards.All of these things are offensive and should be removed.

'@CAPS10, how many @CAPS9 does it take to clean up the house? None because they're dirty so way does it matter.' I know then you would want the library to remove that book.

Absolutely! I believe we should, at least for the children. There are some pretty bad things out there that I do not believe are quite appropriate for children, or even teenagers. If I were a parent, there are many things I would not let my child read or look at. If we don't even give them a chance to see them, then we wouldn't have to worry. Chidren these day are not what they used to be. What would their great grandparents think if they saw the way today's adolescents act, dress, and even talk? Where do you think they get this from? The answer is simple. They get it from today's movies, books, music, and magazines. We cannot keep going on like this or eventually we will have toddlers acting inappropriately! I know from experience that when children are small and they see or hear something, it sticks with them for a long time. If child is looking through a magazine and they see a questionable picture, they are not likely to forget that picture very soon. Or if they are listening to a song with bad words, don't be surprised if they do not forget them or even start repeating them. That is just the how small children are. My last point is the fact that parents would probably be much happier if offensive material was removed from libraries. Parents would be able to bring their children to the library and not have to worry about what they are looking at or listening to. The children would feel a sense of freedom and the parents would, in return, feel a sense of reassurance. Offensive material should definitely be removed from our libraries in order to keep our children pure and their parents happy. I understand that others would argue that if we take out offensive material then eventually, there would be nothing left for our children to read. Well, obviously not everything can be censored, but I think a lot of it should be. Censoring material in libraries is definitely the way to go, not just for our children, but also our teenagers\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 651:\n","Essay Text: Libraries @CAPS1 we would do without books?

I do not believe books that some people find offensive should not be taken of shelfs, because they @MONTH1 not be offensive to other people. Books should be seperated by reading levels in libraries.

Having books organized by reading levels will make life much easier for a person looking for a certin reading level. Music should be put in to certin catorgies such as rock, jazz, rap or country. Childrens music should be in the kids section along with the books, magazines and movies. Doing this for the children will keep them away from unappriate music, books, maganzies and movies.

I know this might be alot of work but it is needed, so kids aren't aloud to go in ths section. This will help ruduce what little kids see. There are also books and magizines that are offensive to children of a different race. These books should be removed from the shelves also because they hert peoples feelings, and this might make customers leave your libary. I am not saying ouhae to take ever single book of your selves, but a least reduce the number of books of your selves out of kids eyes mostly and some adults if they are offended. Next thing that comes to mind is the music on compacked discs, or cd's which ever you perfere. In this day and age there are alot of musicians out there that have alot of bad words in their songs. These songs; are songs parents dont like there children to listen to, because parents are afraid of their children here these words and repeating them at home. These type of cd's should be taken of shelves where kids are, and put in a section also labled adults only. I know this wont stop kids from hearing these words and say them, but at least the parents can blame you for their child saying these words, because you did the smart thing and put these cd's out of kids reach. There are songs that are ofensive to people but i know you cant go throught every song and take them off the shelves, but a least take the cd's off the shelve that you know are offensive to people. The last that comes to mind that should be taken off the shelves that are material children shouldnt see is the movies. There are movies out there that are to graphic, to vilent, and to much nudity that kids dont need to see. These type of movies need to also get a section that is for adults only. Then you have the movies that need to just be taking off the shelve because they are to offensive to some viewers. I know that you @MONTH1 say but if it is offensive to them, they dont have to get it. This maybe true but a least move the to a section that those people that get offended dont go.

If people take offense to it, read something else. There are far too many opinions in this world to take one person's and get mad about it. Libraries are centers of education. They hold the information to our past and possibly our future. If we are willing to learn about what happened and accept it. Once again, it's not meant to cause anger among groups or people.

These books that are found offensive to some @MONTH1 not be offensive to others, heres an example, lets say there is a recovering alcoholic and this person is flipping through a magazine and they see a alcoholic beverage ad in the magazine. This would be offensive to them but to the person next to him that collects fine wines its not offensive to him. This is all a matter of opinion, another example, there is a magazine that comes in that has a ammo add and one of the librarians finds it bad, but the others like to hunt game and they find it helpful to read an ad about ammounition for their next vacation to alaska. As i said before it is all a sense of oppinions. Its one persons oppinion aganist others and its a never ending cycle, and its never going to stop. Basically this censorship is a game of he said , she said, and it is not fair to the people to take something away just because a few people do not like it. Some people found racial profiling offensive others did not, some people seen what @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was doing was right, others didnt.

Taking good books off shelves, that @MONTH1 not be good books for @PERSON1 children, instead should be catagorized in sections for @PERSON1 children, pre-teens, teenagers, and adults.

I went to the computers to see if my favorite book available. The computer showed that the book was taken off the shelf for offending readers. I checked another list that listed numerous books, music, movies, and magazines that were also taken off of the shelves. Half of the list, I had checked out already. The librarian said the council is voting to take or not take specific books, music, movies, and other items off of the shelves for offensive content. As a regular library customer, I felt I needed to express my opinion of the topic. I believe that before these materials are taken off of the shelves that the librarians need to consider an age limit, a 'three strikes your out' rule, or how much these materials mean to people. Offending people is not what these materials are meant to do. Some books can be perceived in that way which makes the readers angry. I can understand someone's feelings being hurt by a certain topic of reading, but that person @MONTH1 not be mature enough to comprehend what the book is intending as a message. My sister who is the age of ten has read a book which offended her, but she also didn't know what the book really was about. I believe that anyone the age of sixteen or older should be allowed access to these books, music, movies, and magazines. Age sixteeen is when most people are already in high school and more mature. Anyone younger than that shouldn't be allowed access to these items. If the readers are mature enough to handle the material, then people @MONTH1 not be offended as much. Another new rule the library could try is the 'three strikes you're out rule.' @CAPS1 rule is when someone behaves inappropriately. Some people who behave inappropriately will tell everyone the book is offensive and make up stories about the book so their friends will laugh. Each person receives a strike every time they behave inappropriately. @CAPS1 includes in a school classroom as well as the library. After a certain amount of strikes, that person wouldn't be allowed to check out the material. The librarians could keep a record of @CAPS1 which could be accessed whenever. Even if the person is of age to check out the material, they couldn't do so if they had a certain amount of strikes on their record. These materials mean a great deal to people. I am an avid reader as well as movie watcher. When I read a book, I feel like I have freedom. No one is telling me I perceive the book wrong, or that isn't what the character would look like. Reading a book is my own imagination making up the pictures of the story in my head. Taking these items off of the shelves takes away people's immagination. It also takes away from the writers freedom of speech in the @CAPS2 of @CAPS3. The writers wrote their book under that @CAPS2 and now there freedom is basically being taken away from them by taking there speech off of shelves. Overall, I believe that these materials shouldn't be taken off of the shelves. The librarians should consider either making up new rules or thinking about people's opinions of the subject. The librarians should also consider the freedom of speech rule when they are taking these materials off of the shelves. If they don't consider any of these options, then all offensive materials would be taken away. One person could say a book or movie is offensive and it would be taken off of the shelf. After awhile, the library would eventually become empty.

So my answer is no, no books, music, movies, magazines should be banned from the library because one person, or mabye the majority of people find it offensive. There is no reason to tarnish anyone elses reading, listening, or watching anything of their interest because others find it offensive. The solution that could solve all this, is for the people that find them offensive, can just completely ignore that material.I can understand by my own experiences how people can find such materials a problem though. For an example, I've read books, listened to music, watched movies, even read magazines that were offensive too me. The biggest problem that occurs in those materials to make them offensive, is usually racism. Most people can deal with it though, so if they can you should be able to, right?

So what do you do about this situation? Yes, there might be some books that could be offensive to people if they are about certain things. What if a little kid is in the adult area looking at books and they find a book they shouldn't have seen? Well most parents would want those books to be removed from the library. There could also be books that are just offensive to adults because of what they are about. I've seen people at my library get offended by something they read and they didn't want it back on the shelf. What if there are some @CAPS1's that a little kid checks out and it has language in the music? I don't think that any of that music should be in the library at all. Especially with little kids roaming the library. The music in the library could be offensive to other people to. Not just young kids. When you walk into a library usually the first thing you see are magazines. There can be some pretty inapropriate magazines with inapropriate covers. Is this really what you want people looking at?

What if one of those old movies had a bad cover on it, or bad language? A lot of movies are also offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3. I think this because, back in the old days there was a lot of racism, and that is still in alot of movies now. There could also be movies against someones religion. That could be very offensive to certain people. Most of this stuff in libraries can be offensive to young kids because of the covers. Some can be offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because of racism. I think that if you have a problem with something that you see on a shelf, you should tell the librarian and see if they will take it off the shelf. You shouldn't have to be offended by something at the library. I think that people should have their rights to get certain materials off of the shelf.

There are somethings that should be kept from the kids eyes. What are some of the movies, books, or magazines that should be hidden from children? This is probably what you are woundering. The first thing that kids should not be allowed to borrow would be movies that have any that is over there age requirement to see at the movie theather. The reason this is so that the teenager or young child does not watch anything that @MONTH1 scary them. Another thing that should not be seen would be the movies that are meant for a mature veiwer meaning an adult viewer. There are a few books that kids should not be able to read until they are an adult. And these books would be the ones that have a harsh backround on past events that happened.

There are some movies, books, music, magazines that do not need to be sensored for people to see. Starting with why some movie do not need to be sensored. First is because most movies are funny but have just a little need of maturity. These movies are the ones that have alot of comedy and as most adults know most kids are into the funny movies. So why take away a movie that is something a kid would have a great time watching. There are some books that should probably be read by adults but there are some teenagers that are mature enough to read this stories. Or if they need to learn about a specific topic for school work they should be allowed to read that book. I do not think that any genre or group of music should be sensored. This because music is a way for someone to express themselves without even having to truely say anything. about who they are or what kind of a mood they are in. music does much more then just that though it helps some people vent on there anger or even how sad they @MONTH1 be.

You know how most songs can be played and have alof of 'negative' lyrics? Well I believe that can be fix, because not everything you say do not have to be with a vulgar word or end with one. Music is not about '@CAPS1, @CAPS2, or even @CAPS3', music suppose to make you feel good inside or maybe even down in some people cases, but music is a positive fact and people do not suppose to turn something positive into negative. Books are influencional on me because I like to read, I enjoying reading books that I can relate to and understand cause most people can read something and not understand a thing. As little kids we all were tought to pick up a book and read but as we get older we fall off, but what people do not know is, books help develop your reading and vocabulary skills. Even if you read a magazine, anything would help as long as your reading something. Magazines are basically about the world, celebritys and how the media react, but like a book a magazine do not stick with one topic. Movies especially movies are a big deal in the world. If you havent notice what ever kids/teenagers/ and maybe even adults see in movie they eventually going to do it. All movies should be @NUM1 which mean, everybody could see. People fail to realize movies are not reality, what you see in movies you can not do in reality, it might be base on real stuff but its not. I love movies and im sure everybody else do to but they should really vision proof it.

Libraries are suppose to have books that everyone can read and learn from, so if they don't have books for everyone the library should'nt be there. I disagree with removing certain material from the library and here is why. First, the reason why i would'nt remove certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc., because the library is a place where people come to learn about new things. Just because one person does'nt like the book does'nt make it right for them to remove it. If people don't wont their children to read the book don't let them go to the library. They go buy their child some good books to read. Also, no one would want to go to a library that does'nt have what they are looking for. That would'nt be a good look for the library, because if someone goes there and find that all the books their looking for is not in and this is the only library in town they would never want to go back there again. Then they would tell moe people about how that library does'nt have anything your looking for in it. Then, the library would get old close down then get knocked down, and in the shot were the library use to be would be a mini mall, food store, ect. so i really don't think it's a good idea to take book off the shelves at the libraries. We need those books because you never know when something can come up and you need that one book that is not there. In conclusion, removing books from the shelves is a bad thing to do. No matter what people think about the books the person who made it made it for a reason thats why he/she is a writer.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 222:\n","Essay Text: library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library to the little kids heads. Kid's reading offensive things and seeing offensive things will hurt them due to them still learning basic things in life. Once when I was little, I picked up and read a book about drugs and sex. They talked about how they feel, where you can get them from, and what they looked like. For a minor reading on how to get drugs and use them, that's telling them to much. It is not a good thing to tell kid's so early in their life about drugs because, they are going to get curious about how the drugs feel. When I was told about drugs I was very curious and I wanted to learn more about them. The older and boring we become the more we will want to try the drugs we learned about earlier in our lives. More people every day try drugs because there is nothing else to do. When I learned about sex while being a kid made me want to try it because they made it sound good in books. Being teached offensive things in libraries is a bad thing because, who would think something bad could be in a library? You go to the library to learn good things about life and if their are offensive things in books and in writing you will pick them bad things up in your life. For all minors do not read nothing about drugs, sex, or anything that does not have to do about education or life.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 223:\n","Essay Text: library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library public library?

Everyone has different interests. People @MONTH1 read one specific type of book and only that type. Others will read all types. Some people @MONTH1 think that books are too scary, violent, or sexual. Others @MONTH1 enjoy the thrill in them and want to read these books. There are many ways in which a book could be inappropriate. This, however, does not mean libraries should have censorship. Libraries should have sections that are age appropriate. That way if a book is too bad in some way then the mature audience would read it and an audience that should be reading children's books would not be in that section. Another reason they should not be allowed to take books off of shelves is because it's disrespectful to the author. The author took a long time creating their book aimed towards a specific audience. For someone to take it off a shelf and ruin peoples chances for being able to read that is awful and it should not be allowed. Taking a book off of the shelf is like and author coming up and destroying all of the hard work you have worked for. Many people might find a book that is very inappropriate and want it to be disposed of but as you can see, its not right. There would be no books left on the shelves.

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exaclty the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' -@ORGANIZATION1 quote moves mountians with its wisdom. In @ORGANIZATION1 day and age, many of the things we read/see in magazines, movies, the news etc. are considered to be quite offensive to many. Would a mother of a fifteen year old be upset if @CAPS5 found her daughter reading a magazine that stated, 'safe sex is great sex', or a father finding his teenage son watching a movie with pornographic scenes? The answer is no. The magazines, movies, music and books that are being sent out into libraries all over the world are not exactly '@CAPS1 rated' and many adults would be shocked to realize exactly what it is teenagers are viewing; but is it right to then remove everything some one finds to be wrong or offensive? Lets think about religion for a second. Atheists would find the bible to be a lie, maybe even find it offensive. So in turn to be considerate of their beliefs does that make it 'right' to remove the bible from libraries and open access to the public? Think about the novel, 'To @CAPS2 a @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. English scholars around the world will state that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a novel of its time; that it will continue to be read hundreds of years from now at schools around the world. Some though, would find @ORGANIZATION1 book offensive. The word 'nigger' is placed in @ORGANIZATION1 novel many times and is set in a time when slavery is not frowned apon. Just because one parent finds @ORGANIZATION1 book to be offensive does that mean students from all over should no longer be allowed to read it; that @ORGANIZATION1 book should be 'removed from the shelves?' The questions posed here are not simple questions, they require much time and thought. If a survey was posted asking: Should certain materials be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? The outcome would be intangible to think about now, considering people have many different views on the aspect. In reading @ORGANIZATION1 and contemplating the questions asked you will realize that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a black or white concept; there lies a large area of grey in the middle. Something that one @MONTH1 find offensive, another would not; something a teenager views as interesting an adult @MONTH1 view as crude or vulger. Does @ORGANIZATION1 mean that everything would be taken down from the shelves then? Yes. In the quote above by Katherine Paterson, @CAPS5 states, '.. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS5 is correct in @ORGANIZATION1 because @CAPS5 realizes that everyone has different views on what is appropriate or not. @ORGANIZATION1 statement shows that although libraries @MONTH1 allow inappropriate novels, magazines, tapes etc. to be open to the easy access of customers there is no way that they would be able to make everyone feel content without completely wiping out the building of its contents. The right to take a book away also is a right to leave it; leave the books then and let the ones who enjoy them, simply enjoy.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 226:\n","Essay Text: library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library to throw the book away or call the artist of the song and ask them what they was thinking!

I hope what I have to say will give you a clear idea or a new perspective, and that you might understand what I think the importance of censorship in libraries really means, and not just to me, but to all who pick up a book. To answer my previous question, censoring is the removing of suggestive or otherwise offensive materials from any or all sources of information, or entertainment. Now I'll ask another question; why do we have censorship? Most believe that all children have a right to know things they'll learn about eventually whether or not they want to, and therefore don't care when their children are exposed to that knowledge. Those people don't consider the consequences of that knowledge in the wrong hands, or wrong minds. Children don't think on the same track that most adults do, and therefore are incapable of handling certain knowledges that adults have long since known and otherwise dealt with. Those who know of the consequences of certain knowledges in the wrong minds have tried to keep the information from those who can't or shouldn't worry about them untill they're older and more capable of understanding what it all means. A lot of ideas we have @DATE1, from science and technology, from philosophical thinking to common sense, most everything has been written down in the past, or is being written @DATE1. That's where the problems arise. Almost everything is written about or recorded in some way, therefore increasing the chances that someone will hear or see this knowledge and, not knowing it's importance, might even abuse it eventually. Think about the crimes that go on @DATE1. Are all of them simple? Do they all focus on the same things? How do they come about? All these questions are able to be answered in the simplest ways; the people who commited them learned about something too early in life and grew up thinking it was ok, whether they learned it from books, or music, or movies, etc., and eventually repeated these things they learned. Of course that's not always the case, but for those people who don't know why so many people ended up as the people who get thrown into jail, or get into trouble, a major factor is what they learn at an early age, and not having sensible people to help them to know what's right and what's wrong. To conclude, I think the best ways to avoid the wrong information getting into the wrong hands, is to have censorship in libraries. Without it, people can just walk up to any shelf and pick up that one book, even a nine-year-old child.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 230:\n","Essay Text: library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library puplic places for that reason though. You have to take a lot into conciteration before decideing weather it should be censored or not. Age is one aspect. If the material is not sutable to a sertain age then it should be organized into a different age category according to the library. I believe that there should be age limits like the ones they have on movies or video games. Rescently there was a book, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, that was questioned on the use of language in it. I think that the author wrote their book the way they want it and would like it sold that way not have it censored. If you find something offensive that doesen't mean you should keep getting involved with it. If there is a book or movie that is offfensive to you, you can stop reading or stop watching it at your own will. Often on the radio there are songs that use innapropriate language and it is bleeped out. Why should we bleep it? Some people could find it more offensive to hear it bleeped than to hear the words just said. And thier oppinion should be the one that counts. The questin weather there should be censorship in libraries is all about a persons perspecitve. Someone is always going to see it differently than you. There is nothing bad about that. I remember watching a show one time and there were these characters in a book club and they were debateing the book its self. Not always is everyone going to like your oppinion of something but you shouldn't despise people for that. I believe that the libraries should not have to use censorship when we have lived as humans long enough to be able to make a decision for ourselves. We should stop being told what to do by rules and laws all the time and have our oppinions heard.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 231:\n","Essay Text: library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library why we are @CAPS1.

There's a certain point to where yeah things should not be writen or films that should'nt have been made but if you dont like it, then dont read it and or watch it. People all have a right to the libraries. Nobody forces anyone to read or watch something, its by the readers choice. Theres no sence in ruining many peoples enjoyment just because a selected few people dont like something. Thats like the @ORGANIZATION2 not having any football just because the players feel like they dont get payed enough @MONEY1 to play it. Taking books and magazines off the library shelves is like the @ORGANIZATION2 locking out everything. Just because a few people arent happy, doesnt mean that everything should be taking out so others cant enjoy it. Why even have a library if your going to change everything because people get offended. Is @ORGANIZATION1 going to stop carrying penuts because some people are allergic to them? No. If people dont like something they have the choice to buy or take it if they want to or not. Its a simple fact that some things should just be left alone. People are all different. Its going to take a long time for people to figure that out. In fact, people @MONTH1 never figure that out.

The book is baby blue and has a little bird on it. However, the book also has a half naked man on cover besided the cute little bird. The girl grabs the book and goes happly to find her mom. When the mom looks at the book her face is in shock. What would you do if that was your daughter? Most likely we'd put the book back and explain why she can't have it. While, others would go screaming to the check out and asking, 'how is it possible that my daughter got this? Shouldn't the libraries be wacthing the kids to make sure they don't go in that section?'. I believe that certain materials, such as books,movies, ect., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact people will still find way to get the removed material and that it's just a part of life. My first reason that certain materials, such as books, shouldn't be pulled from are shelves is that we live in a nation that prides it's self as the '@CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. That doesn't mean we get everything for @CAPS2 when we go to a store it just simple means that you, the people of @LOCATION1, have the freedom and right to speak your mind. So you can say whatever you want in newspapers or in books because the government gives you that right. However, you can't say 'I have a bomb' at the airports because of the many attacks the nation has encountered over the years, but that's common sences. My second reason that certain materials should say on the put, even if someone is offened by it is that no matter how many books or movies you take of the store shelves, the people will find a way to get them. One way to get them is the black market where people sell drugs and weapons. Do we, as a country really need another drug on the market even if it's a book? I think not. Also, if you look at the whole picture people will be losing jobs because the televison today is not the kind they had back in your grandma's day. Nearly @PERCENT1 of everything on televison has something to do with the little three letter s-word every parent hates to talk about. You might be thinking that if we take the unrated movies and the books with the naked men on the cover we'd be saving are children which leads me to my last point. Seeing unrated movies and such is a part of life. So what are you saving them from? Children sooner or later will grow up and learn about the types of subject matter so why take it off when you will have to teach them about it sooner rather then later? Millions of parents around the @CAPS3 each and every year have to teach their kids about the birds and the bees. It's a part of growing up in a way. Now a days though, the birds and the bees are all people seem to talk about. So like it or not your kids will find out just like you did and your parents before you. Plus, your not going to make everyone happy. Someone will always be offened by something. Imagine. Imagine that same little girl, now an adult, having to deal with that same issue of the same baby blue book with the same little bird with the half naked man on the cover. The truth is that this way my mother when she was little and it turns out that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree because I had the same issue as well. I know that one day I will also have the same issue as my mother did before me. So I believe that certain materials, such as books and movies, shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact that people will still find a way to get the removed material and that it's just apart of life.

There is what I believe to be an appropriate division on the materials in our libraries and bookstores, the fact that we can always monitor what our children read and watch, and not to mention that we can use the internet to back up any doubts we have on the literature and lyrics.The question that remains is: Are we using the ways of preventing this problem to the best of our abilities? I believe that our public libraries and bookstores do a splendid job of diviying up what is deemed appropriate for each age group. Teens know a fairly good amount more about things than all parents invision they shouldn't, and I think the bookstores and libraries keep the youths knowledge in what they're listening, watching, and reading to what these kids already know. Comparing what is considered a 'young adult' book and an 'adult' book, you will find an atrocious difference. Young adult books only hint around things such as drugs, refraining from abstinence, and grisly murder scenes whereas adult books go into a great deal more detail. Middle school level children's books are even more less detailed than teen books, so it is save to say that as long as the parents are directing their child into the appropriate section in anyone's given local library, they will be in good hands. There's also the option of monitering what our young ones are listening to. By simply being interested in what it is that the child is singing or humming along to, us parents would find that they wouldn't be reluctant to let on about what was being said. If in any case we feel that the lyrics are too harsh for the kid, we are still their parents and have the right to deem it as something they shouldn't be listening to and suggest something different to them and/or ban them from being able to listen. In @CAPS1 cases though, we should try to listen to what our kids are. In this way, we can be reassured that the range of materials they're plugging into their ears are not what we would consider to be grotesque for something our children's age. Another useful tool would have to be the internet. If we don't feel the need to ask about the literature or music, but @MONTH1 still have a few doubts, there are plenty of book and music blogs across the world wide web that can help us out. Even by going to a bookstore website and reading the description about the book, or a lyric website that will tell us what is being said, or even a movie website where we can see a rating and the content of the movie, and the comments left by people that go with it respectively, @CAPS1 of us would find all of the information we need. Even author's, director's, and artist's websites would be useful. Looking at their discussions would be a big help as well, considering that @CAPS1 of these people have a vision of what age groups would be attracted to their material. In conclusion, I think our children are fairly wise about what they choose to read, listen to, and watch, but then again, it all depends on the preference. Not every child is the same, just as not any adult, or any one person. The prefernce tends to lean towards the things we think are appropriate. Paying attention to what the young ones are like says alot about what they read, and what they listen to and watch, for that matter. We have all these ways of keeping our children from reading, watching and listening to inappropriate things, we just have to make them and asset\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 236:\n","Essay Text: library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library to be open to teenagers and possibly children. In my opinion I think that it is not right for libraries not to do anything about this problem, especially when this is happening across the nation. In large department stores such as @ORGANIZATION1, you are required to be eighteen years old to purchase adult items, sometimes you must be twenty-one years of age. It is considered illegal for anyone under the required age to purchase an item with an age limit on it. Music is a totally different type of profanity, @CAPS1 albums are sold with much innapropiate material in them that is open to the public, but the @CAPS1's sold in stores are usually edited into a more appropiate version. Days like today nearly no one ever buys @CAPS1's anymore, its all about @CAPS4's and @NUM1's where all you have to do is find your song on a site and download it for free in about four to five seconds. It would not surprise me if libraries had music and @CAPS1's with just as much adult profanity, and language that is not edited out. So if most of the things in this world that are adult rated and can not be purchased unless your considered an adult by age, why should it be ok to viewed by any age in a library. I myself believe that it should be illegal for materials such as the ones mentioned to be banned or atleast taken more respected with the viewer of the materials. It would really hurt a parent for them to take a kid to a library and tell them to go find a book they like, and they return to their mother or father with an adult book with many things a child or possibly a teenager should not see. I believe times like those could tear a parent or even a grandparent apart, having to explain to their children or grandchildren what they just saw. Because most of us know that most children always want to know what something is when they see it, and for a parent to have to explain to their child at that age has to be heart-stopping. In all of this that I have explained is only my opinion, but I believe many other millions of people agree with me. If it is not aloud almost everywhere else in this world, why should it be ok a library to do it? Is it because its some little rule about freedom of decision? Do libraries think just because they are old fashioned and have been here longer than the @CAPS1's, @CAPS4's, and @NUM1's that they dont have to follow rules and guidelines. It is a shame that they are ruining the lives and visions of the children and teens today to think its ok for anyone to see, listen, or watch these materials.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 237:\n","Essay Text: library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library One reason is that they relate to people lifestyles.Some books relate to family issues and have negativity about them.

Also they can b threatening to children that are being bullyed. Also, movies can be offending. Movies that are based on bad action should be removed. Most of these movies consider harsh words. Children that like action movies should not be listening to anything like that. Action movies have a lot of abuse in them. Young children can act these movies out and hurt other children. Some movies also have violence in them. If children see people using violence in the movies they would want to do it to because they think its cool. Also people in these kind of movies use bad treatment toward people. This can effect people lives. Also, magazines that are offending people should also be removed. Magazines show and tell things that celebrities are doing. Not only will young children do these things but young adults. Magazines also show people criticizing politics. Some @MONTH1 include talking bad about the @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @CAPS1. Young adults @MONTH1 take this the wrong way and start doing the same thing. This @MONTH1 also make it seem like they are bad people. Also, they use verbal abuse and use bad lauguages. Some books, movies, and magazines should be removed if they are offensive to people.

There should be a section limit where children can't go by to get to the offensive type books and others. Why take things that older people would insist on looking at off the shelf just because someone didn't separate the adult books and etc., from the childrens. Taking away the things that adults look at would be just as bad as taking the things that children or teens would like such as the music and movies, even though the music sometimes influnce some children to do bad or get off track from being who they really are. I don't understand why take those type things down when you are getting benefits off the things that people buy that will help keep libraries open such as fun rasier type. If you don't have things in a library that will capture a young persons attention like the movies, music, or magazines then children or teens will not be interested on going to libraries. Adults nor teens will sit in a library with under age books, movies, or music. Reason being is, becuase they are muture and not exactly looking for a book with lots of pictures and cartoons unless they are reading to an under age sibling. When that child has to go to library with his or her parent for example to do a project that parent would rather not just sit and wait the whole time for his or her child to finish. That is where the magazines come in ; magazines are very interesting books such as @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS2 @CAPS3 those magazines occupy peoples time while they are waiting just like any other places. Everywhere you go children are going to see things that they shouldn't see at their age, because television and the internet has so many componets that will cause a distraction to a childs mind that will make them question everything they see. That child will soon have to learn. That is how most children are becoming so blunt with the things they do or say, because either they seen it or heard it. I know you @MONTH1 think that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves to keep out of reach of children, but I think that if you are able to separate all upper age group books, movies, music, magazines from all children and other young adults, the library would become more beneficial to everyone that has access to a local library.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 239:\n","Essay Text: library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library Now, I will tell the many readers that will read this article what I think should be and what should not be on the shelf. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories, should teach lessons, and should not be offensive. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories. When I sit down to read a book or magazine, or to watch a movie, I want to read or watch an interesting story. A little child is not going to want to read a book about history or science, they will want to read about @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @LOCATION2, or @ORGANIZATION1. Children will not sit still unless they have something to read or watch that is interesting and appealing to them. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should teach lessons. I believe that libraries should have books, magazines, etc., that teach them how to tie their shoes, to count, or to say the alphabet. Children love to sing, so simply put a @CAPS3 in that sings the alphabet, and the child will be singing along shortly. When a child pulls a book off of the shelf at a library, that shows a pretty picture, the child will be attracted to it, and learn as they read or watch. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be offensive. Kids should not read a book, magazine, etc., if the author is talking about harming someone or something. If the book, magazine, etc., has inappropriate language or insult someone, that book needs to be taken off of the shelf and immediately thrown in the trash. The last thing a parent wants is their child to learn something bad from a book and repeat it at school, because that will only lead up to the child getting in serious trouble. Again, I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be banned from the shelves if they are found offensive. Parents do not want to get a phone call from the schoool principal saying their child is using inappropriate language, or being offensive to others. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell wonderful stories, should teach children things that will help them in school, and should not say harmful things about someone or something. Children can learn so much from books, music, movies, magazines, etc., so why make them say offensive or disrespectful things?\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 240:\n","Essay Text: library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library think they learn from reading historical text, and getting outher peoples opinions on things.

In many cases libraries have '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' in which books, that the majority of people would consider explicit, are held. These @CAPS2 are normally closed off and a person has to exert some sort of physical motion through a barrier in order to enter, therefore they are in full knowledge that there @MONTH1 be offensive literature there. One also must take into account the meaning of the term '@CAPS3 @CAPS4'. That term has a key phrase in the title, @CAPS3, which is almost a warning in itself that the literature in it @MONTH1 be offensive to someone. These points show that there should be no restriction on the books, magazines or music in @CAPS3 libraries. The first topic of discussion is the definition of obscene. There are @NUM1 billion people, in the @LOCATION1 alone, that all have their own views of what they consider obscene to be. If one asked an avid conservative their thoughts on obscenity, they would differ by a tremendous amount of those that a free-spirited individual would have. The inconsistency of views is an obvious reason to keep all types of books in libraries. Not only that but also the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 allows libraries to put grossly obscene literature in a hidden, but accessible area. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are made for one purpose, to sheild the general @CAPS3 of things that would be seen by the majority as obscene. These @CAPS2 are not out in the open where anyone can stumble upon them, they are usually in a corner of the @CAPS4, closed off, and marked '@CAPS1'. These @CAPS2 allow a little bit of compromise between the two sides of the debate for censorship, by still allowing all types of literature, but also sheilding anyone from seeing or hearing any of it unpurposefully. Because of these @CAPS2 there is no way anyone could complain about obscenity in the general @CAPS4 setting. For the libraries without @CAPS1 @CAPS2, there is the warning on the door of the @CAPS4, the word @CAPS3. @CAPS3 libraries are intended for the @CAPS3. Walking into one, under ones own power, dispells any complaints one would have about obscenity. This is because the act of entering a @CAPS3 @CAPS4, puts one in the atmosphere of the @CAPS4, whatever it @MONTH1 be. Libraries should not be held responsible for whether or not the literature on their shelves is offensive. The word @CAPS3 in the term @CAPS3 @CAPS4 is, like said previously, a warning of its own, letting anyone know who is entering that there is a chance there @MONTH1 be some things that person could precieve as obscene. This and multiple other reasons put to rest any thought one would have about removing certain literature from libraries. The three reasons given, along with the many more out there left unsaid, make it inevitable that libraries are not ment to be censored. The fact that the word obscene can not be tailored to fit everyone's personal views, the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and the word @CAPS3 placed infront of @CAPS4, warning everyone any type of literature could be in said @CAPS4, are enough to disspell any thought of censoring libraries.

At a young age we are taught right from wrong. Everyone has different rights and many different wrongs, that they are taught by their parents. It is those morals we our taught that help us decide what we should listen to or what we shoud read. I am a high school student that is very aware of right or wrong. Though my choices @MONTH1 not show as much. I am very aware of what I read and put into my head. Who wants to have certain magazine sex stories in their head? Not me, thats for sure! That makes any guy a perverse guy. I don't read books the tell me how to get in a girl's pants, that is wrong and I belive that should be censored. As a high school guy looking at a girl can be tough on some and then deciding to read about how to get a girl only encourages those types of attitudes. It is the exact same for girls too. Reading wrong stuff puts it into your head. What goes in your head comes out. Music is very influential in todays world. Rap for instence talks about money, sex, and drugs. Like I said garbage in is garbage out. Rap does have a good side too, all music does it is just an example. Then you have rockstars that do the exact same thing. All music depending on the genre you listen to, does say a lot about the person he/ or she is. Christen music does not need to be censored, because it is positive and up-lifting. Not all songs on the radio need to be censored either. Yes the ones talking about sex, drugs, and other terrible things need to be censored. Why would you want to put that stuff in your head? It makes no sense if that is who you want to be, a unintellegent person that no one likes, due to your moods. Movies could do without all the vulgar language and the sex scenes. Movies are meant to be enjoyed. Movies recently have not been family oriented. Transformers for example is a go out with your friends movie. The @CAPS1 series should never have been created. The person that made the @CAPS1 series has a very dark and twisted mind. Scary movies have a purpose for @CAPS3 and other festivities. Scary or not it should have less sex scenes. You should not have to worry what your child is going to see if he/ or she goes out to the movies with friends. Movies play a big part in our economy and that means many adults, teenagers, and children our watching something that is or is not good for their mind and well-being, but movies still have positive impact, jsut depends on what your watching. It is very obvious that our society has different views on, if things should be censored or not. People have their own lifes to lead and live, it is their right to decide what is right and what is wrong. Books, music, and movies influence our society in many ways. Yes some things need to be censored, because music and movies are making some things socially acceptable. When growing up not all things are socially acceptable, or so we are taught. Schools should not censor many books or our music selections, because it is high school it is when we discover ourselves. It is the morals that we are taught that define us, and what we learn from those morals of what is right or wrong to; read, listen to, or watch, that is what builds us as people to grow. You put garbage in your morals with what you do, you are only going to get garbage out\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 244:\n","Essay Text: library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library many people find too innappropriate for freshman to be reading about. However, it seems to me that we are exposed to offensive things every day and it is not plausible to simply censor every innappropriate thing we come across. In terms of censorship in libraries, it is outlandish to think that we could do the same thing. When people visit libraries, they are there to check out books that they want to read. While there @MONTH1 be many forms of offensive media avaliable to the public through the library, that doesn't mean that people are obligated to view them. We are all perfectly capable of choosing for ourselves what we put into our minds. Because the media advertises offensive things all the time, we cannot block out everything. However we can chose what it is that we want to read when we visit the library. Since it is a choice, it shouldn't be necessary to censor everything there because you don't have to chose to view it. Censorship is also very subjective. What is deemed offensive to someone, @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else. If we oblige to sensor everything anyone claims to be offensive, there would no longer be any forms of media left. This is much like the quote from Katherine Paterson, where she says, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We rid the libraries of what each person finds offensive and what do you have left? Being around things we find offensive is, sadly, a part of life. That does not mean that we have engage in such things. It will never get to a point where everyone is completely happy with the way things are being censored unless everything is done away with, and that would only bring about new issues. We have to have the self control to provide censorship for ourselves, we cannot leave that job to other people.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 245:\n","Essay Text: library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library its amazing you feel like your really their.

Just for the simple fact that it @MONTH1 not be inappropriate for adults and it could be something that they would like to read. Also almost every library has a childrens section for a certain age group and under to pick out a book for themselves to read. If they go to the adult section and get a book it is their parent or guardians responsibility to make sure they @CAPS1 at the books the child has picked out. They can choose to do that or let the child get the book. I have not personally seen a book that should not be on a shelf in the library, but my mom has told me about something she had seen. My mother had seen a magazine that had said, '@CAPS1! To @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4!' I dont think they should take things like that away because it could be something someone wants to read. If a child sees it then the parent was not paying that good of attention to them. @CAPS3 can be prevented to where it is not a problem.

Someone a little bit older then me picked up the book and checked it out, my mom said you can read that when you get older just not right for your age.

The people that do like the action or humor or romance books would probably be upset @CAPS3 they took them away.Its also not fair because @CAPS3 takes away what they actually come to the library for in the first place. People that are offended by things always have other places to go to find books and movies and things like that. Not everybody has money to spend on movies. The library is a great place to barrow free movies and books and magazines if you cant afford to buy any. My family didnt have mony to buy any movies so we would go straight to the library to get free ones. Movies now days are very expinsive to jus be buying all the time. In the long run those movie cost are going to add up. Removing everything offensive would really limit the good choices in the library. If you are just left with all the boaring material nobody will come but the ones who got offended. People want the good stuff thats why majority of the folks go. I useally go for the music, books, and movies, but i would just leave if i saw they took all the good choices away. I left the library once because they took away my favorite book, 'A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. I loved that book and they told me they no longer have @CAPS3. I really had no other reason to go other then the music. Then they took all the hip hop away and i just never went any more. So takeing away all the offensive things will jus mess @CAPS3 up for everybody. Not everyone gets offended about small things. If they were to take they were to take them away, @CAPS3 wouldnt be fair, people would lose money they dont have, and @CAPS3 would limit all the good choices. So please dont take anything good out of the library.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 249:\n","Essay Text: library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library book offensive, wouldn't you want that book remove? Having material that is offensive to people in libraries is just plain wrong. The reason I believe that libraries should remove offensive material because, I always see books and movies that are racist toward @CAPS1. Like these qoutes '@CAPS1 are fat and lazy people.''@CAPS1 are border jumpers.''All @CAPS1 are good is farming and cleaning.' @CAPS5 on now, not all @CAPS1 are fat. Some of us have jobs and are tired from working long hours. We are not border jumpers. We have our passports/ green cards.All of these things are offensive and should be removed. I know other @CAPS1 get offended when they see this stuff. Let's say that you're @CAPS8 and you walk into the libray and you see a book all about jokes. You pick up the book and start looking through it and you @CAPS5 across a section about your race. The joke says 'All @CAPS9 are hillbillies.' '@CAPS10, how many @CAPS9 does it take to clean up the house? None because they're dirty so way does it matter.' I know then you would want the library to remove that book. All I'm saying is that having offensive material in the libraries is wrong. They should remove those books, music, movies, and magazines when people complain about them. You wouldn't want your children asking you questions like 'Are we dirty @CAPS9 @CAPS13?' or ' @CAPS14 are we wetbacks?' So yes I believe that those things should be remove from the shelves.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 250:\n","Essay Text: library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library things I would not let my child read or look at. If we don't even give them a chance to see them, then we wouldn't have to worry. Chidren these day are not what they used to be. What would their great grandparents think if they saw the way today's adolescents act, dress, and even talk? Where do you think they get this from? The answer is simple. They get it from today's movies, books, music, and magazines. We cannot keep going on like this or eventually we will have toddlers acting inappropriately! I know from experience that when children are small and they see or hear something, it sticks with them for a long time. If child is looking through a magazine and they see a questionable picture, they are not likely to forget that picture very soon. Or if they are listening to a song with bad words, don't be surprised if they do not forget them or even start repeating them. That is just how small children are. My last point is the fact that parents would probably be much happier if offensive material was removed from libraries. Parents would be able to bring their children to the library and not have to worry about what they are looking at or listening to. The children would feel a sense of freedom and the parents would, in return, feel a sense of reassurance. Offensive material should definitely be removed from our libraries in order to keep our children pure and their parents happy. I understand that others would argue that if we take out offensive material then eventually, there would be nothing left for our children to read. Well, obviously not everything can be censored, but I think a lot of it should be. Censoring material in libraries is definitely the way to go, not just for our children, but also our teenagers\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 251:\n","Essay Text: library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library library people from the past and our present, fiction and nonfiction stories and many more.

I do not believe books that some people find offensive should not be taken of shelfs, because they @MONTH1 not be offensive to other people. Books should be seperated by reading levels in libraries. Having a kid, teen and adult section, will help organize a library. This will make it much easier for children to find books that they can actually read. Also if children books are seperated of adult books parents wont find any book offencive to their children. Having books organized by reading levels will make life much easier for a person looking for a certin reading level. Music should be put in to certin catorgies such as rock, jazz, rap or country. Childrens music should be in the kids section along with the books, magazines and movies. Doing this for the children will keep them away from unappriate music, books, maganzies and movies. The music section should not have any bad language in the music that they allow to be checked out. If anyone considered any of the music in the library offensive the library should remove it. Movies should also be seprated by age levels. G, @CAPS2, @NUM1, and @CAPS3 should be the catorgies that the movies should be put into.

These meterials could consist of nude pictures and so on. Most parents do not want to see there kids getting a hold of this type of material. You maybe think 'what could we do about this things, or least come to a compermise to make almost everyone happy. I have so reasons why we should put this type of material away from kids sight and reach. First of all, the books and magizines that have any nude in them, should have their own section and, be labled aduts only. I know this might be alot of work but it is needed, so kids aren't aloud to go in ths section. This will help ruduce what little kids see. There are also books and magizines that are offensive to children of a different race. These books should be removed from the shelves also because they hert peoples feelings, and this might make customers leave your libary. I am not saying ouhae to take ever single book of your selves, but a least reduce the number of books of your selves out of kids eyes mostly and some adults if they are offended. Next thing that comes to mind is the music on compacked discs, or cd's which ever you perfere. In this day and age there are alot of musicians out there that have alot of bad words in their songs. These songs; are songs parents dont like there children to listen to, because parents are afraid of their children here these words and repeating them at home. These type of cd's should be taken of shelves where kids are, and put in a section also labled adults only. I know this wont stop kids from hearing these words and say them, but at least the parents can blame you for their child saying these words, because you did the smart thing and put these cd's out of kids reach. There are songs that are ofensive to people but i know you cant go throught every song and take them off the shelves, but a least take the cd's off the shelve that you know are offensive to people. The last that comes to mind that should be taken off the shelves that are material children shouldnt see is the movies. There are movies out there that are to graphic, to vilent, and to much nudity that kids dont need to see. These type of movies need to also get a section that is for adults only. Then you have the movies that need to just be taking off the shelve because they are to offensive to some viewers. I know that you @MONTH1 say but if it is offensive to them, they dont have to get it. This maybe true but a least move the to a section that those people that get offended dont go. Those were my thoughts on what should be done with material thats to offensive and not aprobriet for eyes or minds.These might be a little extreme but i hope you at least take some of these things into consideration. You cant please all but you can try. Thanks for reading this and i hope it as changed your thoughts on material thats bad for kids to see\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 254:\n","Essay Text: censorship censorship believe that there are some materials that should not be allowed on the shevles.

People need to know what happened in the past so they can move on in the future.

These books that are found offensive to some @MONTH1 not be offensive to others, heres an example, lets say there is a recovering alcoholic and this person is flipping through a magazine and they see a alcoholic beverage ad in the magazine. This would be offensive to them but to the person next to him that collects fine wines its not offensive to him.

I went to the computers to see if my favorite book available. The computer showed that the book was taken off the shelf for offending readers. I checked another list that listed numerous books, music, movies, and magazines that were also taken off of the shelves. Half of the list, I had checked out already. The librarian said the council is voting to take or not take specific books, music, movies, and other items off of the shelves for offensive content. As a regular library customer, I felt I needed to express my opinion of the topic. I believe that before these materials are taken off of the shelves that the librarians need to consider an age limit, a 'three strikes your out' rule, or how much these materials mean to people. Offending people is not what these materials are meant to do. Some books can be perceived in that way which makes the readers angry. I can understand someone's feelings being hurt by a certain topic of reading, but that person @MONTH1 not be mature enough to comprehend what the book is intending as a message. My sister who is the age of ten has read a book which offended her, but she also didn't know what the book really was about. I believe that anyone the age of sixteen or older should be allowed access to these books, music, movies, and magazines. Age sixteeen is when most people are already in high school and more mature. Anyone younger than that shouldn't be allowed access to these items. If the readers are mature enough to handle the material, then people @MONTH1 not be offended as much. Another new rule the library could try is the 'three strikes you're out rule.' @CAPS1 rule is when someone behaves inappropriately. Some people who behave inappropriately will tell everyone the book is offensive and make up stories about the book so their friends will laugh. Each person receives a strike every time they behave inappropriately. @CAPS1 includes in a school classroom as well as the library. After a certain amount of strikes, that person wouldn't be allowed to check out the material. The librarians could keep a record of @CAPS1 which could be accessed whenever. Even if the person is of age to check out the material, they couldn't do so if they had a certain amount of strikes on their record. These materials mean a great deal to people. I am an avid reader as well as movie watcher. When I read a book, I feel like I have freedom. No one is telling me I perceive the book wrong, or that isn't what the character would look like. Reading a book is my own imagination making up the pictures of the story in my head. Taking these items off of the shelves takes away people's immagination. It also takes away from the writers freedom of speech in the @CAPS2 of @CAPS3. The writers wrote their book under that @CAPS2 and now there freedom is basically being taken away from them by taking there speech off of shelves. Overall, I believe that these materials shouldn't be taken off of the shelves. The librarians should consider either making up new rules or thinking about people's opinions of the subject. The librarians should also consider the freedom of speech rule when they are taking these materials off of the shelves. If they don't consider any of these options, then all offensive materials would be taken away. One person could say a book or movie is offensive and it would be taken off of the shelf. After awhile, the library would eventually become empty.

So my answer is no, no books, music, movies, magazines should be banned from the library because one person, or mabye the majority of people find it offensive. There is no reason to tarnish anyone elses reading, listening, or watching anything of their interest because others find it offensive. The solution that could solve all this, is for the people that find them offensive, can just completely ignore that material.I can understand by my own experiences how people can find such materials a problem though. For an example, I've read books, listened to music, watched movies, even read magazines that were offensive too me. The biggest problem that occurs in those materials to make them offensive, is usually racism. Most people can deal with it though, so if they can you should be able to, right? As I have stated before, just because you don't like it does not mean that you should disapprove of it. If you disapprove of it and get the material removed from the library then the others who liked it, won't be able to read, listen, nor watch it.The statement I'm making here, is me pretty much saying that onless you only care about yourself, then sure report about it.If you are not a person that only cares of yourself, then you would let the book stay even though you don't like it, because others @MONTH1 like it. My observations of this sort of thing is I've seen people complain how they've read this book, and it was racist towards their well-being. From my own personal readings I've understood that many people have a lot of pride for themselves of who they are and what they are. People need to understand though, it was written by someone else.You @MONTH1 judge, but out of your own respect, should not report to remove of something for their ideas.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 262:\n","Essay Text: censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship the shelves if they are offensive. I think that some people have different things they like to read and listen to. Someone might like a certain type of book, and another might think it's offensive. So what do you do about this situation? Yes, there might be some books that could be offensive to people if they are about certain things. What if a little kid is in the adult area looking at books and they find a book they shouldn't have seen? Well most parents would want those books to be removed from the library. There could also be books that are just offensive to adults because of what they are about. I've seen people at my library get offended by something they read and they didn't want it back on the shelf. What if there are some @CAPS1's that a little kid checks out and it has language in the music? I don't think that any of that music should be in the library at all. Especially with little kids roaming the library. The music in the library could be offensive to other people to. Not just young kids. When you walk into a library usually the first thing you see are magazines. There can be some pretty inapropriate magazines with inapropriate covers. Is this really what you want people looking at? Especially young kids? There are also movies at a library. Yes, most of them are old movies, but some of them are also kids movies. What if one of those old movies had a bad cover on it, or bad language? A lot of movies are also offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3. I think this because, back in the old days there was a lot of racism, and that is still in alot of movies now. There could also be movies against someones religion. That could be very offensive to certain people. Most of this stuff in libraries can be offensive to young kids because of the covers. Some can be offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because of racism. I think that if you have a problem with something that you see on a shelf, you should tell the librarian and see if they will take it off the shelf. You shouldn't have to be offended by something at the library. I think that people should have their rights to get certain materials off of the shelf. Especially if they think it's offensive to them, or anybody else that might happen to see the same thing. Is this really what we want in our libraries is offensive materials?

And why somethings do not need to be sensored at the library. I will help you to understand what young teenagers or younger children should and should not be able to see or borrow from the library. There are somethings that should be kept from the kids eyes. What are some of the movies, books, or magazines that should be hidden from children? This is probably what you are woundering. The first thing that kids should not be allowed to borrow would be movies that have any that is over there age requirement to see at the movie theather. The reason this is so that the teenager or young child does not watch anything that @MONTH1 scary them. Another thing that should not be seen would be the movies that are meant for a mature veiwer meaning an adult viewer. There are a few books that kids should not be able to read until they are an adult. And these books would be the ones that have a harsh backround on past events that happened. Like what happen during a war to a captured soldier or a prisoner of war. And what they to go through during their imprisonment. These are the books that should be hidden from younger childern. There are some movies, books, music, magazines that do not need to be sensored for people to see. Starting with why some movie do not need to be sensored. First is because most movies are funny but have just a little need of maturity. These movies are the ones that have alot of comedy and as most adults know most kids are into the funny movies. So why take away a movie that is something a kid would have a great time watching. There are some books that should probably be read by adults but there are some teenagers that are mature enough to read this stories. Or if they need to learn about a specific topic for school work they should be allowed to read that book. I do not think that any genre or group of music should be sensored. This because music is a way for someone to express themselves without even having to truely say anything. about who they are or what kind of a mood they are in. music does much more then just that though it helps some people vent on there anger or even how sad they @MONTH1 be. But in conclusion I think there are many things that are good but still need to be sensored for most of the young childern and teenagers to be able to see.

However, books and magazines that give out informative data with proper conduct should be allowed. If libraries create an area in which peoples' prefrences are to view content over the age of @NUM1, they should be required to have their own membership. In order to even look at material that is uncensored, visitors need a special pass; this way people who get offended by material that is not censored do not have to pass it while inside the library. Many people who do not want to go out and spend @MONEY1 on a movie rental like to go to the library. Libraries should allow movies from the ranges of ratings @CAPS1(@CAPS2) to @CAPS3(@CAPS4) to be on the shelves of the library. Going into a public library should not have any more restrictions that going into a public video store. However, videos that are considered 'pornography,' should not be in any part of the library. Just like in a public video store, libraries should not contain any footage that is considered pornography. Much of the popular music today is considered offensive. The music in libraries can still be the same songs, but they need to have clean content in them. I believe that edited music in libraries is okay under any circumstances. I do not believe that explicit music is okay. People inside the library could be listening to this explicit music before they take it home, while others in the library get offended by it. People overhearing music would not happen often, but we need to make sure it does not happen at all. Overall, material in libraries that could be considered offensive should not be allowed to be viewed except under special memberships that have proof that an individual is over the age of @NUM1. We all need to work together to make sure our libraries stay clean and unoffensive.

I disagree with removing certain material from the library and here is why. First, the reason why i would'nt remove certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc., because the library is a place where people come to learn about new things. Just because one person does'nt like the book does'nt make it right for them to remove it. If people don't wont their children to read the book don't let them go to the library. They go buy their child some good books to read. Also, no one would want to go to a library that does'nt have what they are looking for. That would'nt be a good look for the library, because if someone goes there and find that all the books their looking for is not in and this is the only library in town they would never want to go back there again.

They talked about how they feel, where you can get them from, and what they looked like. For a minor reading on how to get drugs and use them, that's telling them to much. It is not a good thing to tell kid's so early in their life about drugs because, they are going to get curious about how the drugs feel. When I was told about drugs I was very curious and I wanted to learn more about them. The older and boring we become the more we will want to try the drugs we learned about earlier in our lives. More people every day try drugs because there is nothing else to do. When I learned about sex while being a kid made me want to try it because they made it sound good in books.

Libraries should have sections that are age appropriate. That way if a book is too bad in some way then the mature audience would read it and an audience that should be reading children's books would not be in that section. Another reason they should not be allowed to take books off of shelves is because it's disrespectful to the author. The author took a long time creating their book aimed towards a specific audience.

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exaclty the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' -@ORGANIZATION1 quote moves mountians with its wisdom. In @ORGANIZATION1 day and age, many of the things we read/see in magazines, movies, the news etc. are considered to be quite offensive to many. Would a mother of a fifteen year old be upset if @CAPS5 found her daughter reading a magazine that stated, 'safe sex is great sex', or a father finding his teenage son watching a movie with pornographic scenes? The answer is no. The magazines, movies, music and books that are being sent out into libraries all over the world are not exactly '@CAPS1 rated' and many adults would be shocked to realize exactly what it is teenagers are viewing; but is it right to then remove everything some one finds to be wrong or offensive? Lets think about religion for a second. Atheists would find the bible to be a lie, maybe even find it offensive. So in turn to be considerate of their beliefs does that make it 'right' to remove the bible from libraries and open access to the public? Think about the novel, 'To @CAPS2 a @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. English scholars around the world will state that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a novel of its time; that it will continue to be read hundreds of years from now at schools around the world. Some though, would find @ORGANIZATION1 book offensive. The word 'nigger' is placed in @ORGANIZATION1 novel many times and is set in a time when slavery is not frowned apon. Just because one parent finds @ORGANIZATION1 book to be offensive does that mean students from all over should no longer be allowed to read it; that @ORGANIZATION1 book should be 'removed from the shelves?' The questions posed here are not simple questions, they require much time and thought. If a survey was posted asking: Should certain materials be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? The outcome would be intangible to think about now, considering people have many different views on the aspect. In reading @ORGANIZATION1 and contemplating the questions asked you will realize that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a black or white concept; there lies a large area of grey in the middle. Something that one @MONTH1 find offensive, another would not; something a teenager views as interesting an adult @MONTH1 view as crude or vulger. Does @ORGANIZATION1 mean that everything would be taken down from the shelves then? Yes. In the quote above by Katherine Paterson, @CAPS5 states, '.. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS5 is correct in @ORGANIZATION1 because @CAPS5 realizes that everyone has different views on what is appropriate or not. @ORGANIZATION1 statement shows that although libraries @MONTH1 allow inappropriate novels, magazines, tapes etc. to be open to the easy access of customers there is no way that they would be able to make everyone feel content without completely wiping out the building of its contents. The right to take a book away also is a right to leave it; leave the books then and let the ones who enjoy them, simply enjoy.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 276:\n","Essay Text: censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship to throw the book away or call the artist of the song and ask them what they was thinking!

So i think there sound be a person to take the stuff off the shelves becuse who would wont there son coming home saying he lerned a new werd today and the werd he said makes your jol derop. At first he's going to lagh at you and say the werd agin. So i say yes to some budy taking that stuff off the shelves. I say alot of poeple would wont there son reading a good book depending on his age. As they grow up they would be able to read skary books or love storys what ever they wont to read. @MONTH1 be he would wont to read about reacing, fire fighters, police, mitstorys about missing poeple.Jazz and other muics needs to be sinered. becuse they say suff that little kids soud not hair at ine time of there little lifes. Poeple dont under stand that little kids are going to acked like us. And that muics teches them diserspect for are elders. Lets say you to the stor with your little boy and there is old man behid you and he said hi to you your little boy will perbole say some like shut up old man. And i think that is not right.Maguzins are ok some times like car maguzins there ok becuse your kid is not going to get a rod with poeple.

I hope what I have to say will give you a clear idea or a new perspective, and that you might understand what I think the importance of censorship in libraries really means, and not just to me, but to all who pick up a book. To answer my previous question, censoring is the removing of suggestive or otherwise offensive materials from any or all sources of information, or entertainment. Now I'll ask another question; why do we have censorship? Most believe that all children have a right to know things they'll learn about eventually whether or not they want to, and therefore don't care when their children are exposed to that knowledge. Those people don't consider the consequences of that knowledge in the wrong hands, or wrong minds. Children don't think on the same track that most adults do, and therefore are incapable of handling certain knowledges that adults have long since known and otherwise dealt with. Those who know of the consequences of certain knowledges in the wrong minds have tried to keep the information from those who can't or shouldn't worry about them untill they're older and more capable of understanding what it all means. A lot of ideas we have @DATE1, from science and technology, from philosophical thinking to common sense, most everything has been written down in the past, or is being written @DATE1. That's where the problems arise. Almost everything is written about or recorded in some way, therefore increasing the chances that someone will hear or see this knowledge and, not knowing it's importance, might even abuse it eventually. Think about the crimes that go on @DATE1. Are all of them simple? Do they all focus on the same things? How do they come about? All these questions are able to be answered in the simplest ways; the people who commited them learned about something too early in life and grew up thinking it was ok, whether they learned it from books, or music, or movies, etc., and eventually repeated these things they learned. Of course that's not always the case, but for those people who don't know why so many people ended up as the people who get thrown into jail, or get into trouble, a major factor is what they learn at an early age, and not having sensible people to help them to know what's right and what's wrong. To conclude, I think the best ways to avoid the wrong information getting into the wrong hands, is to have censorship in libraries. Without it, people can just walk up to any shelf and pick up that one book, even a nine-year-old child.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 280:\n","Essay Text: censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship puplic places for that reason though. You have to take a lot into conciteration before decideing weather it should be censored or not. Age is one aspect. If the material is not sutable to a sertain age then it should be organized into a different age category according to the library. I believe that there should be age limits like the ones they have on movies or video games. Rescently there was a book, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, that was questioned on the use of language in it. I think that the author wrote their book the way they want it and would like it sold that way not have it censored. If you find something offensive that doesen't mean you should keep getting involved with it. If there is a book or movie that is offfensive to you, you can stop reading or stop watching it at your own will. Often on the radio there are songs that use innapropriate language and it is bleeped out. Why should we bleep it? Some people could find it more offensive to hear it bleeped than to hear the words just said. And thier oppinion should be the one that counts. The questin weather there should be censorship in libraries is all about a persons perspecitve. Someone is always going to see it differently than you. There is nothing bad about that. I remember watching a show one time and there were these characters in a book club and they were debateing the book its self. Not always is everyone going to like your oppinion of something but you shouldn't despise people for that. I believe that the libraries should not have to use censorship when we have lived as humans long enough to be able to make a decision for ourselves. We should stop being told what to do by rules and laws all the time and have our oppinions heard.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 281:\n","Essay Text: censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship why we are @CAPS1. Our public libraries have always been safe and clean enviornments and if its not broke dont fix it. I never even heard of a problem in the libraries about things offending people before but sometimes people just need to grow up. There's a certain point to where yeah things should not be writen or films that should'nt have been made but if you dont like it, then dont read it and or watch it. People all have a right to the libraries. Nobody forces anyone to read or watch something, its by the readers choice. Theres no sence in ruining many peoples enjoyment just because a selected few people dont like something. Thats like the @ORGANIZATION2 not having any football just because the players feel like they dont get payed enough @MONEY1 to play it. Taking books and magazines off the library shelves is like the @ORGANIZATION2 locking out everything. Just because a few people arent happy, doesnt mean that everything should be taking out so others cant enjoy it. Why even have a library if your going to change everything because people get offended. Is @ORGANIZATION1 going to stop carrying penuts because some people are allergic to them? No. If people dont like something they have the choice to buy or take it if they want to or not. Its a simple fact that some things should just be left alone. People are all different. Its going to take a long time for people to figure that out. In fact, people @MONTH1 never figure that out. So in my opionion I believe that the libraries can carry anything they want as long as it is appropreit. My thinking is that it will be best if we keep libraries the way they are. In the end, more people will be unhappy of a change than the happier it makes people after the change. in other words the numbers of people who are happy with the change will be out weighed greatly with the people who are unhappy.

The book is baby blue and has a little bird on it. However, the book also has a half naked man on cover besided the cute little bird. The girl grabs the book and goes happly to find her mom. When the mom looks at the book her face is in shock. What would you do if that was your daughter? Most likely we'd put the book back and explain why she can't have it. While, others would go screaming to the check out and asking, 'how is it possible that my daughter got this? Shouldn't the libraries be wacthing the kids to make sure they don't go in that section?'. I believe that certain materials, such as books,movies, ect., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact people will still find way to get the removed material and that it's just a part of life. My first reason that certain materials, such as books, shouldn't be pulled from are shelves is that we live in a nation that prides it's self as the '@CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. That doesn't mean we get everything for @CAPS2 when we go to a store it just simple means that you, the people of @LOCATION1, have the freedom and right to speak your mind. So you can say whatever you want in newspapers or in books because the government gives you that right. However, you can't say 'I have a bomb' at the airports because of the many attacks the nation has encountered over the years, but that's common sences. My second reason that certain materials should say on the put, even if someone is offened by it is that no matter how many books or movies you take of the store shelves, the people will find a way to get them. One way to get them is the black market where people sell drugs and weapons. Do we, as a country really need another drug on the market even if it's a book? I think not. Also, if you look at the whole picture people will be losing jobs because the televison today is not the kind they had back in your grandma's day. Nearly @PERCENT1 of everything on televison has something to do with the little three letter s-word every parent hates to talk about. You might be thinking that if we take the unrated movies and the books with the naked men on the cover we'd be saving are children which leads me to my last point. Seeing unrated movies and such is a part of life. So what are you saving them from? Children sooner or later will grow up and learn about the types of subject matter so why take it off when you will have to teach them about it sooner rather then later? Millions of parents around the @CAPS3 each and every year have to teach their kids about the birds and the bees. It's a part of growing up in a way. Now a days though, the birds and the bees are all people seem to talk about. So like it or not your kids will find out just like you did and your parents before you. Plus, your not going to make everyone happy. Someone will always be offened by something. Imagine. Imagine that same little girl, now an adult, having to deal with that same issue of the same baby blue book with the same little bird with the half naked man on the cover. The truth is that this way my mother when she was little and it turns out that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree because I had the same issue as well. I know that one day I will also have the same issue as my mother did before me. So I believe that certain materials, such as books and movies, shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact that people will still find a way to get the removed material and that it's just apart of life.

We need to do something about this problem. If there are offensive media out there the kids of the future are going to look up to them and try to be like them or hate the same thing that the media does. Let's just say there was a song about school and how people dont like it don't you think our kids are going to hate school too? I don't think that is right. We need to teach our kids that school is very important and not to take in what the media says because they are not always right. We want enjoyable media in the world. We want good things for our future kids to see and hear. We don't want kids picking up bad words. We need to watch what we put out in the world.

Truth be told, there are many ways for our offspring to not have the availability of those books. There is what I believe to be an appropriate division on the materials in our libraries and bookstores, the fact that we can always monitor what our children read and watch, and not to mention that we can use the internet to back up any doubts we have on the literature and lyrics.The question that remains is: Are we using the ways of preventing this problem to the best of our abilities? I believe that our public libraries and bookstores do a splendid job of diviying up what is deemed appropriate for each age group. Teens know a fairly good amount more about things than all parents invision they shouldn't, and I think the bookstores and libraries keep the youths knowledge in what they're listening, watching, and reading to what these kids already know. Comparing what is considered a 'young adult' book and an 'adult' book, you will find an atrocious difference. Young adult books only hint around things such as drugs, refraining from abstinence, and grisly murder scenes whereas adult books go into a great deal more detail. Middle school level children's books are even more less detailed than teen books, so it is save to say that as long as the parents are directing their child into the appropriate section in anyone's given local library, they will be in good hands. There's also the option of monitering what our young ones are listening to. By simply being interested in what it is that the child is singing or humming along to, us parents would find that they wouldn't be reluctant to let on about what was being said. If in any case we feel that the lyrics are too harsh for the kid, we are still their parents and have the right to deem it as something they shouldn't be listening to and suggest something different to them and/or ban them from being able to listen. In @CAPS1 cases though, we should try to listen to what our kids are. In this way, we can be reassured that the range of materials they're plugging into their ears are not what we would consider to be grotesque for something our children's age. Another useful tool would have to be the internet. If we don't feel the need to ask about the literature or music, but @MONTH1 still have a few doubts, there are plenty of book and music blogs across the world wide web that can help us out. Even by going to a bookstore website and reading the description about the book, or a lyric website that will tell us what is being said, or even a movie website where we can see a rating and the content of the movie, and the comments left by people that go with it respectively, @CAPS1 of us would find all of the information we need. Even author's, director's, and artist's websites would be useful. Looking at their discussions would be a big help as well, considering that @CAPS1 of these people have a vision of what age groups would be attracted to their material. In conclusion, I think our children are fairly wise about what they choose to read, listen to, and watch, but then again, it all depends on the preference. Not every child is the same, just as not any adult, or any one person. The prefernce tends to lean towards the things we think are appropriate. Paying attention to what the young ones are like says alot about what they read, and what they listen to and watch, for that matter. We have all these ways of keeping our children from reading, watching and listening to inappropriate things, we just have to make them and asset\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 286:\n","Essay Text: censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship to be open to teenagers and possibly children. In my opinion I think that it is not right for libraries not to do anything about this problem, especially when this is happening across the nation. In large department stores such as @ORGANIZATION1, you are required to be eighteen years old to purchase adult items, sometimes you must be twenty-one years of age. It is considered illegal for anyone under the required age to purchase an item with an age limit on it. Music is a totally different type of profanity, @CAPS1 albums are sold with much innapropiate material in them that is open to the public, but the @CAPS1's sold in stores are usually edited into a more appropiate version. Days like today nearly no one ever buys @CAPS1's anymore, its all about @CAPS4's and @NUM1's where all you have to do is find your song on a site and download it for free in about four to five seconds. It would not surprise me if libraries had music and @CAPS1's with just as much adult profanity, and language that is not edited out. So if most of the things in this world that are adult rated and can not be purchased unless your considered an adult by age, why should it be ok to viewed by any age in a library. I myself believe that it should be illegal for materials such as the ones mentioned to be banned or atleast taken more respected with the viewer of the materials. It would really hurt a parent for them to take a kid to a library and tell them to go find a book they like, and they return to their mother or father with an adult book with many things a child or possibly a teenager should not see. I believe times like those could tear a parent or even a grandparent apart, having to explain to their children or grandchildren what they just saw. Because most of us know that most children always want to know what something is when they see it, and for a parent to have to explain to their child at that age has to be heart-stopping. In all of this that I have explained is only my opinion, but I believe many other millions of people agree with me. If it is not aloud almost everywhere else in this world, why should it be ok a library to do it? Is it because its some little rule about freedom of decision? Do libraries think just because they are old fashioned and have been here longer than the @CAPS1's, @CAPS4's, and @NUM1's that they dont have to follow rules and guidelines. It is a shame that they are ruining the lives and visions of the children and teens today to think its ok for anyone to see, listen, or watch these materials.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 287:\n","Essay Text: censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship One reason is that they relate to people lifestyles.Some books relate to family issues and have negativity about them.

There should be a section limit where children can't go by to get to the offensive type books and others. Why take things that older people would insist on looking at off the shelf just because someone didn't separate the adult books and etc., from the childrens. Taking away the things that adults look at would be just as bad as taking the things that children or teens would like such as the music and movies, even though the music sometimes influnce some children to do bad or get off track from being who they really are. I don't understand why take those type things down when you are getting benefits off the things that people buy that will help keep libraries open such as fun rasier type. If you don't have things in a library that will capture a young persons attention like the movies, music, or magazines then children or teens will not be interested on going to libraries. Adults nor teens will sit in a library with under age books, movies, or music. Reason being is, becuase they are muture and not exactly looking for a book with lots of pictures and cartoons unless they are reading to an under age sibling. When that child has to go to library with his or her parent for example to do a project that parent would rather not just sit and wait the whole time for his or her child to finish. That is where the magazines come in ; magazines are very interesting books such as @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS2 @CAPS3 those magazines occupy peoples time while they are waiting just like any other places. Everywhere you go children are going to see things that they shouldn't see at their age, because television and the internet has so many componets that will cause a distraction to a childs mind that will make them question everything they see.

I know you @MONTH1 think that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves to keep out of reach of children, but I think that if you are able to separate all upper age group books, movies, music, magazines from all children and other young adults, the library would become more beneficial to everyone that has access to a local library.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 289:\n","Essay Text: censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship Now, I will tell the many readers that will read this article what I think should be and what should not be on the shelf. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories, should teach lessons, and should not be offensive. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories. When I sit down to read a book or magazine, or to watch a movie, I want to read or watch an interesting story. A little child is not going to want to read a book about history or science, they will want to read about @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @LOCATION2, or @ORGANIZATION1. Children will not sit still unless they have something to read or watch that is interesting and appealing to them. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should teach lessons. I believe that libraries should have books, magazines, etc., that teach them how to tie their shoes, to count, or to say the alphabet. Children love to sing, so simply put a @CAPS3 in that sings the alphabet, and the child will be singing along shortly. When a child pulls a book off of the shelf at a library, that shows a pretty picture, the child will be attracted to it, and learn as they read or watch. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be offensive. Kids should not read a book, magazine, etc., if the author is talking about harming someone or something. If the book, magazine, etc., has inappropriate language or insult someone, that book needs to be taken off of the shelf and immediately thrown in the trash. The last thing a parent wants is their child to learn something bad from a book and repeat it at school, because that will only lead up to the child getting in serious trouble. Again, I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be banned from the shelves if they are found offensive. Parents do not want to get a phone call from the schoool principal saying their child is using inappropriate language, or being offensive to others. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell wonderful stories, should teach children things that will help them in school, and should not say harmful things about someone or something.

In many cases libraries have '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' in which books, that the majority of people would consider explicit, are held. These @CAPS2 are normally closed off and a person has to exert some sort of physical motion through a barrier in order to enter, therefore they are in full knowledge that there @MONTH1 be offensive literature there. One also must take into account the meaning of the term '@CAPS3 @CAPS4'. That term has a key phrase in the title, @CAPS3, which is almost a warning in itself that the literature in it @MONTH1 be offensive to someone. These points show that there should be no restriction on the books, magazines or music in @CAPS3 libraries. The first topic of discussion is the definition of obscene. There are @NUM1 billion people, in the @LOCATION1 alone, that all have their own views of what they consider obscene to be. If one asked an avid conservative their thoughts on obscenity, they would differ by a tremendous amount of those that a free-spirited individual would have. The inconsistency of views is an obvious reason to keep all types of books in libraries. Not only that but also the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 allows libraries to put grossly obscene literature in a hidden, but accessible area. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are made for one purpose, to sheild the general @CAPS3 of things that would be seen by the majority as obscene. These @CAPS2 are not out in the open where anyone can stumble upon them, they are usually in a corner of the @CAPS4, closed off, and marked '@CAPS1'. These @CAPS2 allow a little bit of compromise between the two sides of the debate for censorship, by still allowing all types of literature, but also sheilding anyone from seeing or hearing any of it unpurposefully. Because of these @CAPS2 there is no way anyone could complain about obscenity in the general @CAPS4 setting. For the libraries without @CAPS1 @CAPS2, there is the warning on the door of the @CAPS4, the word @CAPS3. @CAPS3 libraries are intended for the @CAPS3. Walking into one, under ones own power, dispells any complaints one would have about obscenity. This is because the act of entering a @CAPS3 @CAPS4, puts one in the atmosphere of the @CAPS4, whatever it @MONTH1 be. Libraries should not be held responsible for whether or not the literature on their shelves is offensive. The word @CAPS3 in the term @CAPS3 @CAPS4 is, like said previously, a warning of its own, letting anyone know who is entering that there is a chance there @MONTH1 be some things that person could precieve as obscene. This and multiple other reasons put to rest any thought one would have about removing certain literature from libraries. The three reasons given, along with the many more out there left unsaid, make it inevitable that libraries are not ment to be censored. The fact that the word obscene can not be tailored to fit everyone's personal views, the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and the word @CAPS3 placed infront of @CAPS4, warning everyone any type of literature could be in said @CAPS4, are enough to disspell any thought of censoring libraries. Underground bunkers were designed to sheild and censor the @CAPS3, not libraries.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 292:\n","Essay Text: censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship tell about one of my personal experiences with something like this.

And older kids looking at them and getting some ideas from them and going home and doing them. Which could cause harm of even death.

That night when I got home I asked my mom if she colud read it to me before I went to bed. So she did and when she opened the book it had alot of bad words in it. That are bad for little childeren to hear. So she to it to the principal the next day and showed it to him and he fired the teacher for having the book on the shelves.

At a young age we are taught right from wrong. Everyone has different rights and many different wrongs, that they are taught by their parents. It is those morals we our taught that help us decide what we should listen to or what we shoud read. I am a high school student that is very aware of right or wrong. Though my choices @MONTH1 not show as much. I am very aware of what I read and put into my head. Who wants to have certain magazine sex stories in their head? Not me, thats for sure! That makes any guy a perverse guy. I don't read books the tell me how to get in a girl's pants, that is wrong and I belive that should be censored. As a high school guy looking at a girl can be tough on some and then deciding to read about how to get a girl only encourages those types of attitudes. It is the exact same for girls too. Reading wrong stuff puts it into your head. What goes in your head comes out. Music is very influential in todays world. Rap for instence talks about money, sex, and drugs. Like I said garbage in is garbage out. Rap does have a good side too, all music does it is just an example. Then you have rockstars that do the exact same thing. All music depending on the genre you listen to, does say a lot about the person he/ or she is. Christen music does not need to be censored, because it is positive and up-lifting. Not all songs on the radio need to be censored either. Yes the ones talking about sex, drugs, and other terrible things need to be censored. Why would you want to put that stuff in your head? It makes no sense if that is who you want to be, a unintellegent person that no one likes, due to your moods. Movies could do without all the vulgar language and the sex scenes. Movies are meant to be enjoyed. Movies recently have not been family oriented. Transformers for example is a go out with your friends movie. The @CAPS1 series should never have been created. The person that made the @CAPS1 series has a very dark and twisted mind. Scary movies have a purpose for @CAPS3 and other festivities. Scary or not it should have less sex scenes. You should not have to worry what your child is going to see if he/ or she goes out to the movies with friends. Movies play a big part in our economy and that means many adults, teenagers, and children our watching something that is or is not good for their mind and well-being, but movies still have positive impact, jsut depends on what your watching. It is very obvious that our society has different views on, if things should be censored or not. People have their own lifes to lead and live, it is their right to decide what is right and what is wrong. Books, music, and movies influence our society in many ways. Yes some things need to be censored, because music and movies are making some things socially acceptable. When growing up not all things are socially acceptable, or so we are taught. Schools should not censor many books or our music selections, because it is high school it is when we discover ourselves. It is the morals that we are taught that define us, and what we learn from those morals of what is right or wrong to; read, listen to, or watch, that is what builds us as people to grow. You put garbage in your morals with what you do, you are only going to get garbage out\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 294:\n","Essay Text: censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship many people find too innappropriate for freshman to be reading about. However, it seems to me that we are exposed to offensive things every day and it is not plausible to simply censor every innappropriate thing we come across. In terms of censorship in libraries, it is outlandish to think that we could do the same thing. When people visit libraries, they are there to check out books that they want to read. While there @MONTH1 be many forms of offensive media avaliable to the public through the library, that doesn't mean that people are obligated to view them. We are all perfectly capable of choosing for ourselves what we put into our minds. Because the media advertises offensive things all the time, we cannot block out everything. However we can chose what it is that we want to read when we visit the library. Since it is a choice, it shouldn't be necessary to censor everything there because you don't have to chose to view it. Censorship is also very subjective. What is deemed offensive to someone, @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else. If we oblige to sensor everything anyone claims to be offensive, there would no longer be any forms of media left. This is much like the quote from Katherine Paterson, where she says, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We rid the libraries of what each person finds offensive and what do you have left? Being around things we find offensive is, sadly, a part of life. That does not mean that we have engage in such things. It will never get to a point where everyone is completely happy with the way things are being censored unless everything is done away with, and that would only bring about new issues. We have to have the self control to provide censorship for ourselves, we cannot leave that job to other people.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 295:\n","Essay Text: censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship its amazing you feel like your really their.

You can whin and pull a fit all you want. But, really what good is it going to do. To me it looks like your nothing but brats. A parents job isn't to be your childs best friend or anything. Its to be a parent. As a parent you have to make choices that teens @MONTH1 hate you for. But in the long run they will realize you made those choices for them is cause you cared. So personally I really don't think its the music's fault or movies,magazines,etc. I think its the way those kids are rised in their household, that impacts the choices they make. Heres an example, I saw this really awesome video game that I wanted once. But my dad said no. Cause its language and themes were bad. At first I thought I hated my dad. But now I'm glad I didn't buy it. Cause what good would a video game do in the long run. Will it pay bills? No it won't. Will it bring food to the table? No it won't. Will it help you get married? No I think not. The point is the choices made now is what is going to effect you in the long run. I really think its choice. If you make the choice of buying a movie or book,music etc.With that kind of offensive behavior. Then, thats how your representing youself to others around you. But always think of the possible influence you could have on someone but not intented for it to happen.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 296:\n","Essay Text: censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship censorship and to not do the things to are bad.

Just for the simple fact that it @MONTH1 not be inappropriate for adults and it could be something that they would like to read. Also almost every library has a childrens section for a certain age group and under to pick out a book for themselves to read. If they go to the adult section and get a book it is their parent or guardians responsibility to make sure they @CAPS1 at the books the child has picked out. They can choose to do that or let the child get the book. I have not personally seen a book that should not be on a shelf in the library, but my mom has told me about something she had seen. My mother had seen a magazine that had said, '@CAPS1! To @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4!' I dont think they should take things like that away because it could be something someone wants to read. If a child sees it then the parent was not paying that good of attention to them. @CAPS3 can be prevented to where it is not a problem. I was in the library not long ago and I found a book that I wanted to read, but my mother seen the cover and the section it was in and she told me to take it back. Someone a little bit older then me picked up the book and checked it out, my mom said you can read that when you get older just not right for your age. So I listened to her and I understand why but do not take it off the shelf, no reason to. There are ways to make sure inappropriate books do not get into childrens hands. If we were to take any book off of the shelf that we did not approve of there would not be any books left, there is always going to be something wrong with every book.

Plus @CAPS3 would limit all the good choices to pick from in the library, I think its not fair for the other people because not everybody thinks the same. The people that do like the action or humor or romance books would probably be upset @CAPS3 they took them away.Its also not fair because @CAPS3 takes away what they actually come to the library for in the first place. People that are offended by things always have other places to go to find books and movies and things like that. Not everybody has money to spend on movies. The library is a great place to barrow free movies and books and magazines if you cant afford to buy any. My family didnt have mony to buy any movies so we would go straight to the library to get free ones. Movies now days are very expinsive to jus be buying all the time. In the long run those movie cost are going to add up. Removing everything offensive would really limit the good choices in the library. If you are just left with all the boaring material nobody will come but the ones who got offended. People want the good stuff thats why majority of the folks go. I useally go for the music, books, and movies, but i would just leave if i saw they took all the good choices away. I left the library once because they took away my favorite book, 'A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. I loved that book and they told me they no longer have @CAPS3. I really had no other reason to go other then the music. Then they took all the hip hop away and i just never went any more. So takeing away all the offensive things will jus mess @CAPS3 up for everybody. Not everyone gets offended about small things. If they were to take they were to take them away, @CAPS3 wouldnt be fair, people would lose money they dont have, and @CAPS3 would limit all the good choices.

The reason I believe that libraries should remove offensive material because, I always see books and movies that are racist toward @CAPS1.

Some of us have jobs and are tired from working long hours. We are not border jumpers. We have our passports/ green cards.All of these things are offensive and should be removed.

You pick up the book and start looking through it and you @CAPS5 across a section about your race. The joke says 'All @CAPS9 are hillbillies.' '@CAPS10, how many @CAPS9 does it take to clean up the house? None because they're dirty so way does it matter.' I know then you would want the library to remove that book. All I'm saying is that having offensive material in the libraries is wrong. They should remove those books, music, movies, and magazines when people complain about them. You wouldn't want your children asking you questions like 'Are we dirty @CAPS9 @CAPS13?' or ' @CAPS14 are we wetbacks?'

What would their great grandparents think if they saw the way today's adolescents act, dress, and even talk? Where do you think they get this from? The answer is simple. They get it from today's movies, books, music, and magazines. We cannot keep going on like this or eventually we will have toddlers acting inappropriately! I know from experience that when children are small and they see or hear something, it sticks with them for a long time. If child is looking through a magazine and they see a questionable picture, they are not likely to forget that picture very soon. Or if they are listening to a song with bad words, don't be surprised if they do not forget them or even start repeating them. That is just how small children are. My last point is the fact that parents would probably be much happier if offensive material was removed from libraries. Parents would be able to bring their children to the library and not have to worry about what they are looking at or listening to. The children would feel a sense of freedom and the parents would, in return, feel a sense of reassurance. Offensive material should definitely be removed from our libraries in order to keep our children pure and their parents happy. I understand that others would argue that if we take out offensive material then eventually, there would be nothing left for our children to read.

These meterials could consist of nude pictures and so on. Most parents do not want to see there kids getting a hold of this type of material. You maybe think 'what could we do about this things, or least come to a compermise to make almost everyone happy. I have so reasons why we should put this type of material away from kids sight and reach. First of all, the books and magizines that have any nude in them, should have their own section and, be labled aduts only. I know this might be alot of work but it is needed, so kids aren't aloud to go in ths section. This will help ruduce what little kids see. There are also books and magizines that are offensive to children of a different race. These books should be removed from the shelves also because they hert peoples feelings, and this might make customers leave your libary. I am not saying ouhae to take ever single book of your selves, but a least reduce the number of books of your selves out of kids eyes mostly and some adults if they are offended. Next thing that comes to mind is the music on compacked discs, or cd's which ever you perfere. In this day and age there are alot of musicians out there that have alot of bad words in their songs. These songs; are songs parents dont like there children to listen to, because parents are afraid of their children here these words and repeating them at home. These type of cd's should be taken of shelves where kids are, and put in a section also labled adults only. I know this wont stop kids from hearing these words and say them, but at least the parents can blame you for their child saying these words, because you did the smart thing and put these cd's out of kids reach. There are songs that are ofensive to people but i know you cant go throught every song and take them off the shelves, but a least take the cd's off the shelve that you know are offensive to people. The last that comes to mind that should be taken off the shelves that are material children shouldnt see is the movies. There are movies out there that are to graphic, to vilent, and to much nudity that kids dont need to see. These type of movies need to also get a section that is for adults only.

There are things in this world that kids should not see for a long time. If there are things that are offensive on the shelves, then kids can read it and it could lead to bad things. When you enter a library, you don't want to see something that is very offensive. For example, one time my friend and I walked in to the library and the first thing we saw was a book about inappropiate things. We were young so that was the last thing we wanted to see. It was a horrible thing to see and I feel that no child should have to see that when they go into a library. You can never unsee things. No parent wants their children going into a library and reading things they shouldn't. It @MONTH1 have an affect on their childrens behavior and future.

I know that this @MONTH1 not always be true,but it could be in some cases. If I was to walk into a library today, there probably wouldn't be to many things found offensive. I feel that as the years go on, there are less inappropriate things found on the shelves at libraries because people ask them to remove the book if it is offensive. If I was to find something bad there I would ask them to remove it from the shelf. I believe that everyone should have the right to remove a book from the shelf if it is offensive. I also think that eveyone would need a good reason to remove it because eventually there wouldn't be very many books left on the shelves. I believe that these are all very good reasons to removes offensive books off the shelves at libraries.

People need to know what happened in the past so they can move on in the future.

These books that are found offensive to some @MONTH1 not be offensive to others, heres an example, lets say there is a recovering alcoholic and this person is flipping through a magazine and they see a alcoholic beverage ad in the magazine. This would be offensive to them but to the person next to him that collects fine wines its not offensive to him. This is all a matter of opinion, another example, there is a magazine that comes in that has a ammo add and one of the librarians finds it bad, but the others like to hunt game and they find it helpful to read an ad about ammounition for their next vacation to alaska. As i said before it is all a sense of oppinions. Its one persons oppinion aganist others and its a never ending cycle, and its never going to stop. Basically this censorship is a game of he said , she said, and it is not fair to the people to take something away just because a few people do not like it. Some people found racial profiling offensive others did not, some people seen what @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was doing was right, others didnt. Everyone has an opinion and everyone will express theirs no matter what its about, why they say it, and how you or anyone else feels, and that is how it will be until the end of time, and thats life.

Public libraries have the title 'public' for a reason. Taking good books off shelves, that @MONTH1 not be good books for @PERSON1 children, instead should be catagorized in sections for @PERSON1 children, pre-teens, teenagers, and adults. I beleive that censorship of libraries would be a very ignorant idea. Not to mention that it would create an uproar in the public tax payers.

I do beleive that everyone should have a say in their public libraries to improve them, not disprove them. @PERSON1 children should be restricted from the sections that are not appropriate for their age and should be rederected to locations of sections that are appropriate for their age.

I went to the computers to see if my favorite book available. The computer showed that the book was taken off the shelf for offending readers. I checked another list that listed numerous books, music, movies, and magazines that were also taken off of the shelves. Half of the list, I had checked out already. The librarian said the council is voting to take or not take specific books, music, movies, and other items off of the shelves for offensive content. As a regular library customer, I felt I needed to express my opinion of the topic. I believe that before these materials are taken off of the shelves that the librarians need to consider an age limit, a 'three strikes your out' rule, or how much these materials mean to people. Offending people is not what these materials are meant to do. Some books can be perceived in that way which makes the readers angry. I can understand someone's feelings being hurt by a certain topic of reading, but that person @MONTH1 not be mature enough to comprehend what the book is intending as a message. My sister who is the age of ten has read a book which offended her, but she also didn't know what the book really was about. I believe that anyone the age of sixteen or older should be allowed access to these books, music, movies, and magazines. Age sixteeen is when most people are already in high school and more mature. Anyone younger than that shouldn't be allowed access to these items. If the readers are mature enough to handle the material, then people @MONTH1 not be offended as much. Another new rule the library could try is the 'three strikes you're out rule.' @CAPS1 rule is when someone behaves inappropriately. Some people who behave inappropriately will tell everyone the book is offensive and make up stories about the book so their friends will laugh. Each person receives a strike every time they behave inappropriately. @CAPS1 includes in a school classroom as well as the library. After a certain amount of strikes, that person wouldn't be allowed to check out the material. The librarians could keep a record of @CAPS1 which could be accessed whenever. Even if the person is of age to check out the material, they couldn't do so if they had a certain amount of strikes on their record. These materials mean a great deal to people. I am an avid reader as well as movie watcher. When I read a book, I feel like I have freedom. No one is telling me I perceive the book wrong, or that isn't what the character would look like. Reading a book is my own imagination making up the pictures of the story in my head. Taking these items off of the shelves takes away people's immagination. It also takes away from the writers freedom of speech in the @CAPS2 of @CAPS3. The writers wrote their book under that @CAPS2 and now there freedom is basically being taken away from them by taking there speech off of shelves. Overall, I believe that these materials shouldn't be taken off of the shelves. The librarians should consider either making up new rules or thinking about people's opinions of the subject. The librarians should also consider the freedom of speech rule when they are taking these materials off of the shelves. If they don't consider any of these options, then all offensive materials would be taken away. One person could say a book or movie is offensive and it would be taken off of the shelf. After awhile, the library would eventually become empty.

There is no reason to tarnish anyone elses reading, listening, or watching anything of their interest because others find it offensive. The solution that could solve all this, is for the people that find them offensive, can just completely ignore that material.I can understand by my own experiences how people can find such materials a problem though. For an example, I've read books, listened to music, watched movies, even read magazines that were offensive too me.

What if a little kid is in the adult area looking at books and they find a book they shouldn't have seen? Well most parents would want those books to be removed from the library. There could also be books that are just offensive to adults because of what they are about. I've seen people at my library get offended by something they read and they didn't want it back on the shelf.

What if one of those old movies had a bad cover on it, or bad language? A lot of movies are also offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3.

That could be very offensive to certain people. Most of this stuff in libraries can be offensive to young kids because of the covers. Some can be offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because of racism.

There are somethings that should be kept from the kids eyes. What are some of the movies, books, or magazines that should be hidden from children? This is probably what you are woundering. The first thing that kids should not be allowed to borrow would be movies that have any that is over there age requirement to see at the movie theather. The reason this is so that the teenager or young child does not watch anything that @MONTH1 scary them. Another thing that should not be seen would be the movies that are meant for a mature veiwer meaning an adult viewer. There are a few books that kids should not be able to read until they are an adult. And these books would be the ones that have a harsh backround on past events that happened.

There are some movies, books, music, magazines that do not need to be sensored for people to see. Starting with why some movie do not need to be sensored. First is because most movies are funny but have just a little need of maturity. These movies are the ones that have alot of comedy and as most adults know most kids are into the funny movies. So why take away a movie that is something a kid would have a great time watching. There are some books that should probably be read by adults but there are some teenagers that are mature enough to read this stories. Or if they need to learn about a specific topic for school work they should be allowed to read that book. I do not think that any genre or group of music should be sensored.

Libraries should allow movies from the ranges of ratings @CAPS1(@CAPS2) to @CAPS3(@CAPS4) to be on the shelves of the library. Going into a public library should not have any more restrictions that going into a public video store. However, videos that are considered 'pornography,' should not be in any part of the library.

The music in libraries can still be the same songs, but they need to have clean content in them. I believe that edited music in libraries is okay under any circumstances.

Overall, material in libraries that could be considered offensive should not be allowed to be viewed except under special memberships that have proof that an individual is over the age of @NUM1. We all need to work together to make sure our libraries stay clean and unoffensive.

I disagree with removing certain material from the library and here is why. First, the reason why i would'nt remove certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc., because the library is a place where people come to learn about new things. Just because one person does'nt like the book does'nt make it right for them to remove it. If people don't wont their children to read the book don't let them go to the library. They go buy their child some good books to read. Also, no one would want to go to a library that does'nt have what they are looking for. That would'nt be a good look for the library, because if someone goes there and find that all the books their looking for is not in and this is the only library in town they would never want to go back there again. Then they would tell moe people about how that library does'nt have anything your looking for in it. Then, the library would get old close down then get knocked down, and in the shot were the library use to be would be a mini mall, food store, ect. so i really don't think it's a good idea to take book off the shelves at the libraries. We need those books because you never know when something can come up and you need that one book that is not there. In conclusion, removing books from the shelves is a bad thing to do.

They talked about how they feel, where you can get them from, and what they looked like. For a minor reading on how to get drugs and use them, that's telling them to much. It is not a good thing to tell kid's so early in their life about drugs because, they are going to get curious about how the drugs feel. When I was told about drugs I was very curious and I wanted to learn more about them. The older and boring we become the more we will want to try the drugs we learned about earlier in our lives. More people every day try drugs because there is nothing else to do. When I learned about sex while being a kid made me want to try it because they made it sound good in books. Being teached offensive things in libraries is a bad thing because, who would think something bad could be in a library? You go to the library to learn good things about life and if their are offensive things in books and in writing you will pick them bad things up in your life.

Everyone has different interests. People @MONTH1 read one specific type of book and only that type. Others will read all types. Some people @MONTH1 think that books are too scary, violent, or sexual. Others @MONTH1 enjoy the thrill in them and want to read these books. There are many ways in which a book could be inappropriate. This, however, does not mean libraries should have censorship. Libraries should have sections that are age appropriate. That way if a book is too bad in some way then the mature audience would read it and an audience that should be reading children's books would not be in that section. Another reason they should not be allowed to take books off of shelves is because it's disrespectful to the author. The author took a long time creating their book aimed towards a specific audience. For someone to take it off a shelf and ruin peoples chances for being able to read that is awful and it should not be allowed. Taking a book off of the shelf is like and author coming up and destroying all of the hard work you have worked for. Many people might find a book that is very inappropriate and want it to be disposed of but as you can see, its not right. There would be no books left on the shelves.

And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' -@ORGANIZATION1 quote moves mountians with its wisdom. In @ORGANIZATION1 day and age, many of the things we read/see in magazines, movies, the news etc. are considered to be quite offensive to many. Would a mother of a fifteen year old be upset if @CAPS5 found her daughter reading a magazine that stated, 'safe sex is great sex', or a father finding his teenage son watching a movie with pornographic scenes? The answer is no. The magazines, movies, music and books that are being sent out into libraries all over the world are not exactly '@CAPS1 rated' and many adults would be shocked to realize exactly what it is teenagers are viewing; but is it right to then remove everything some one finds to be wrong or offensive? Lets think about religion for a second. Atheists would find the bible to be a lie, maybe even find it offensive. So in turn to be considerate of their beliefs does that make it 'right' to remove the bible from libraries and open access to the public? Think about the novel, 'To @CAPS2 a @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. English scholars around the world will state that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a novel of its time; that it will continue to be read hundreds of years from now at schools around the world. Some though, would find @ORGANIZATION1 book offensive. The word 'nigger' is placed in @ORGANIZATION1 novel many times and is set in a time when slavery is not frowned apon. Just because one parent finds @ORGANIZATION1 book to be offensive does that mean students from all over should no longer be allowed to read it; that @ORGANIZATION1 book should be 'removed from the shelves?' The questions posed here are not simple questions, they require much time and thought. If a survey was posted asking: Should certain materials be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? The outcome would be intangible to think about now, considering people have many different views on the aspect. In reading @ORGANIZATION1 and contemplating the questions asked you will realize that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a black or white concept; there lies a large area of grey in the middle. Something that one @MONTH1 find offensive, another would not; something a teenager views as interesting an adult @MONTH1 view as crude or vulger. Does @ORGANIZATION1 mean that everything would be taken down from the shelves then? Yes. In the quote above by Katherine Paterson, @CAPS5 states, '.. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS5 is correct in @ORGANIZATION1 because @CAPS5 realizes that everyone has different views on what is appropriate or not. @ORGANIZATION1 statement shows that although libraries @MONTH1 allow inappropriate novels, magazines, tapes etc. to be open to the easy access of customers there is no way that they would be able to make everyone feel content without completely wiping out the building of its contents. The right to take a book away also is a right to leave it; leave the books then and let the ones who enjoy them, simply enjoy.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 326:\n","Essay Text: the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the to throw the book away or call the artist of the song and ask them what they was thinking!

I hope what I have to say will give you a clear idea or a new perspective, and that you might understand what I think the importance of censorship in libraries really means, and not just to me, but to all who pick up a book. To answer my previous question, censoring is the removing of suggestive or otherwise offensive materials from any or all sources of information, or entertainment. Now I'll ask another question; why do we have censorship? Most believe that all children have a right to know things they'll learn about eventually whether or not they want to, and therefore don't care when their children are exposed to that knowledge. Those people don't consider the consequences of that knowledge in the wrong hands, or wrong minds. Children don't think on the same track that most adults do, and therefore are incapable of handling certain knowledges that adults have long since known and otherwise dealt with. Those who know of the consequences of certain knowledges in the wrong minds have tried to keep the information from those who can't or shouldn't worry about them untill they're older and more capable of understanding what it all means. A lot of ideas we have @DATE1, from science and technology, from philosophical thinking to common sense, most everything has been written down in the past, or is being written @DATE1. That's where the problems arise. Almost everything is written about or recorded in some way, therefore increasing the chances that someone will hear or see this knowledge and, not knowing it's importance, might even abuse it eventually. Think about the crimes that go on @DATE1. Are all of them simple? Do they all focus on the same things? How do they come about? All these questions are able to be answered in the simplest ways; the people who commited them learned about something too early in life and grew up thinking it was ok, whether they learned it from books, or music, or movies, etc., and eventually repeated these things they learned. Of course that's not always the case, but for those people who don't know why so many people ended up as the people who get thrown into jail, or get into trouble, a major factor is what they learn at an early age, and not having sensible people to help them to know what's right and what's wrong. To conclude, I think the best ways to avoid the wrong information getting into the wrong hands, is to have censorship in libraries. Without it, people can just walk up to any shelf and pick up that one book, even a nine-year-old child.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 330:\n","Essay Text: the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the puplic places for that reason though. You have to take a lot into conciteration before decideing weather it should be censored or not. Age is one aspect. If the material is not sutable to a sertain age then it should be organized into a different age category according to the library. I believe that there should be age limits like the ones they have on movies or video games. Rescently there was a book, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, that was questioned on the use of language in it. I think that the author wrote their book the way they want it and would like it sold that way not have it censored. If you find something offensive that doesen't mean you should keep getting involved with it. If there is a book or movie that is offfensive to you, you can stop reading or stop watching it at your own will. Often on the radio there are songs that use innapropriate language and it is bleeped out. Why should we bleep it? Some people could find it more offensive to hear it bleeped than to hear the words just said. And thier oppinion should be the one that counts. The questin weather there should be censorship in libraries is all about a persons perspecitve. Someone is always going to see it differently than you. There is nothing bad about that. I remember watching a show one time and there were these characters in a book club and they were debateing the book its self. Not always is everyone going to like your oppinion of something but you shouldn't despise people for that.

There's a certain point to where yeah things should not be writen or films that should'nt have been made but if you dont like it, then dont read it and or watch it. People all have a right to the libraries. Nobody forces anyone to read or watch something, its by the readers choice. Theres no sence in ruining many peoples enjoyment just because a selected few people dont like something. Thats like the @ORGANIZATION2 not having any football just because the players feel like they dont get payed enough @MONEY1 to play it. Taking books and magazines off the library shelves is like the @ORGANIZATION2 locking out everything. Just because a few people arent happy, doesnt mean that everything should be taking out so others cant enjoy it. Why even have a library if your going to change everything because people get offended. Is @ORGANIZATION1 going to stop carrying penuts because some people are allergic to them? No. If people dont like something they have the choice to buy or take it if they want to or not. Its a simple fact that some things should just be left alone. People are all different. Its going to take a long time for people to figure that out. In fact, people @MONTH1 never figure that out.

The book is baby blue and has a little bird on it. However, the book also has a half naked man on cover besided the cute little bird. The girl grabs the book and goes happly to find her mom. When the mom looks at the book her face is in shock. What would you do if that was your daughter? Most likely we'd put the book back and explain why she can't have it. While, others would go screaming to the check out and asking, 'how is it possible that my daughter got this? Shouldn't the libraries be wacthing the kids to make sure they don't go in that section?'. I believe that certain materials, such as books,movies, ect., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact people will still find way to get the removed material and that it's just a part of life. My first reason that certain materials, such as books, shouldn't be pulled from are shelves is that we live in a nation that prides it's self as the '@CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. That doesn't mean we get everything for @CAPS2 when we go to a store it just simple means that you, the people of @LOCATION1, have the freedom and right to speak your mind. So you can say whatever you want in newspapers or in books because the government gives you that right. However, you can't say 'I have a bomb' at the airports because of the many attacks the nation has encountered over the years, but that's common sences. My second reason that certain materials should say on the put, even if someone is offened by it is that no matter how many books or movies you take of the store shelves, the people will find a way to get them. One way to get them is the black market where people sell drugs and weapons. Do we, as a country really need another drug on the market even if it's a book? I think not. Also, if you look at the whole picture people will be losing jobs because the televison today is not the kind they had back in your grandma's day. Nearly @PERCENT1 of everything on televison has something to do with the little three letter s-word every parent hates to talk about. You might be thinking that if we take the unrated movies and the books with the naked men on the cover we'd be saving are children which leads me to my last point. Seeing unrated movies and such is a part of life. So what are you saving them from? Children sooner or later will grow up and learn about the types of subject matter so why take it off when you will have to teach them about it sooner rather then later? Millions of parents around the @CAPS3 each and every year have to teach their kids about the birds and the bees. It's a part of growing up in a way. Now a days though, the birds and the bees are all people seem to talk about. So like it or not your kids will find out just like you did and your parents before you. Plus, your not going to make everyone happy. Someone will always be offened by something. Imagine. Imagine that same little girl, now an adult, having to deal with that same issue of the same baby blue book with the same little bird with the half naked man on the cover. The truth is that this way my mother when she was little and it turns out that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree because I had the same issue as well. I know that one day I will also have the same issue as my mother did before me. So I believe that certain materials, such as books and movies, shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact that people will still find a way to get the removed material and that it's just apart of life.

Let's just say there was a song about school and how people dont like it don't you think our kids are going to hate school too? I don't think that is right. We need to teach our kids that school is very important and not to take in what the media says because they are not always right. We want enjoyable media in the world. We want good things for our future kids to see and hear. We don't want kids picking up bad words. We need to watch what we put out in the world. If there is something offensive remove it from the shelves as soon as possible or just not put it out to the public at all. Offensive media can often start up problems in the world. Weither it's in the @CAPS2.S or somewhere around the world. If a book talks about how bad a certain race is those people that were disliked in the book are going to get even with the people who made the book or other media. Many issues @DATE1 are over media out there in the world. People that work at libraries should keep an eye out for offensive materals and shoud remove them to prevent even more problems. I'm sure libraries all around the world have some kind of offensive media in it. We need to stand up and fight to get rid of all offensive media and make the world a better place. Kid's and adult's love going to the library and their for we need to keep everything clean.

Truth be told, there are many ways for our offspring to not have the availability of those books. There is what I believe to be an appropriate division on the materials in our libraries and bookstores, the fact that we can always monitor what our children read and watch, and not to mention that we can use the internet to back up any doubts we have on the literature and lyrics.The question that remains is: Are we using the ways of preventing this problem to the best of our abilities? I believe that our public libraries and bookstores do a splendid job of diviying up what is deemed appropriate for each age group. Teens know a fairly good amount more about things than all parents invision they shouldn't, and I think the bookstores and libraries keep the youths knowledge in what they're listening, watching, and reading to what these kids already know. Comparing what is considered a 'young adult' book and an 'adult' book, you will find an atrocious difference. Young adult books only hint around things such as drugs, refraining from abstinence, and grisly murder scenes whereas adult books go into a great deal more detail. Middle school level children's books are even more less detailed than teen books, so it is save to say that as long as the parents are directing their child into the appropriate section in anyone's given local library, they will be in good hands. There's also the option of monitering what our young ones are listening to. By simply being interested in what it is that the child is singing or humming along to, us parents would find that they wouldn't be reluctant to let on about what was being said. If in any case we feel that the lyrics are too harsh for the kid, we are still their parents and have the right to deem it as something they shouldn't be listening to and suggest something different to them and/or ban them from being able to listen. In @CAPS1 cases though, we should try to listen to what our kids are. In this way, we can be reassured that the range of materials they're plugging into their ears are not what we would consider to be grotesque for something our children's age. Another useful tool would have to be the internet. If we don't feel the need to ask about the literature or music, but @MONTH1 still have a few doubts, there are plenty of book and music blogs across the world wide web that can help us out. Even by going to a bookstore website and reading the description about the book, or a lyric website that will tell us what is being said, or even a movie website where we can see a rating and the content of the movie, and the comments left by people that go with it respectively, @CAPS1 of us would find all of the information we need. Even author's, director's, and artist's websites would be useful. Looking at their discussions would be a big help as well, considering that @CAPS1 of these people have a vision of what age groups would be attracted to their material. In conclusion, I think our children are fairly wise about what they choose to read, listen to, and watch, but then again, it all depends on the preference. Not every child is the same, just as not any adult, or any one person. The prefernce tends to lean towards the things we think are appropriate. Paying attention to what the young ones are like says alot about what they read, and what they listen to and watch, for that matter. We have all these ways of keeping our children from reading, watching and listening to inappropriate things, we just have to make them and asset\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 336:\n","Essay Text: the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the to be open to teenagers and possibly children. In my opinion I think that it is not right for libraries not to do anything about this problem, especially when this is happening across the nation. In large department stores such as @ORGANIZATION1, you are required to be eighteen years old to purchase adult items, sometimes you must be twenty-one years of age. It is considered illegal for anyone under the required age to purchase an item with an age limit on it. Music is a totally different type of profanity, @CAPS1 albums are sold with much innapropiate material in them that is open to the public, but the @CAPS1's sold in stores are usually edited into a more appropiate version. Days like today nearly no one ever buys @CAPS1's anymore, its all about @CAPS4's and @NUM1's where all you have to do is find your song on a site and download it for free in about four to five seconds. It would not surprise me if libraries had music and @CAPS1's with just as much adult profanity, and language that is not edited out. So if most of the things in this world that are adult rated and can not be purchased unless your considered an adult by age, why should it be ok to viewed by any age in a library. I myself believe that it should be illegal for materials such as the ones mentioned to be banned or atleast taken more respected with the viewer of the materials. It would really hurt a parent for them to take a kid to a library and tell them to go find a book they like, and they return to their mother or father with an adult book with many things a child or possibly a teenager should not see. I believe times like those could tear a parent or even a grandparent apart, having to explain to their children or grandchildren what they just saw. Because most of us know that most children always want to know what something is when they see it, and for a parent to have to explain to their child at that age has to be heart-stopping. In all of this that I have explained is only my opinion, but I believe many other millions of people agree with me. If it is not aloud almost everywhere else in this world, why should it be ok a library to do it? Is it because its some little rule about freedom of decision? Do libraries think just because they are old fashioned and have been here longer than the @CAPS1's, @CAPS4's, and @NUM1's that they dont have to follow rules and guidelines. It is a shame that they are ruining the lives and visions of the children and teens today to think its ok for anyone to see, listen, or watch these materials.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 337:\n","Essay Text: the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the One reason is that they relate to people lifestyles.Some books relate to family issues and have negativity about them.

Children that like action movies should not be listening to anything like that. Action movies have a lot of abuse in them. Young children can act these movies out and hurt other children. Some movies also have violence in them. If children see people using violence in the movies they would want to do it to because they think its cool. Also people in these kind of movies use bad treatment toward people. This can effect people lives. Also, magazines that are offending people should also be removed. Magazines show and tell things that celebrities are doing. Not only will young children do these things but young adults. Magazines also show people criticizing politics.

There should be a section limit where children can't go by to get to the offensive type books and others. Why take things that older people would insist on looking at off the shelf just because someone didn't separate the adult books and etc., from the childrens. Taking away the things that adults look at would be just as bad as taking the things that children or teens would like such as the music and movies, even though the music sometimes influnce some children to do bad or get off track from being who they really are. I don't understand why take those type things down when you are getting benefits off the things that people buy that will help keep libraries open such as fun rasier type. If you don't have things in a library that will capture a young persons attention like the movies, music, or magazines then children or teens will not be interested on going to libraries. Adults nor teens will sit in a library with under age books, movies, or music. Reason being is, becuase they are muture and not exactly looking for a book with lots of pictures and cartoons unless they are reading to an under age sibling. When that child has to go to library with his or her parent for example to do a project that parent would rather not just sit and wait the whole time for his or her child to finish. That is where the magazines come in ; magazines are very interesting books such as @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS2 @CAPS3 those magazines occupy peoples time while they are waiting just like any other places. Everywhere you go children are going to see things that they shouldn't see at their age, because television and the internet has so many componets that will cause a distraction to a childs mind that will make them question everything they see. That child will soon have to learn. That is how most children are becoming so blunt with the things they do or say, because either they seen it or heard it. I know you @MONTH1 think that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves to keep out of reach of children, but I think that if you are able to separate all upper age group books, movies, music, magazines from all children and other young adults, the library would become more beneficial to everyone that has access to a local library.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 339:\n","Essay Text: the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the Now, I will tell the many readers that will read this article what I think should be and what should not be on the shelf. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories, should teach lessons, and should not be offensive. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories. When I sit down to read a book or magazine, or to watch a movie, I want to read or watch an interesting story. A little child is not going to want to read a book about history or science, they will want to read about @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @LOCATION2, or @ORGANIZATION1. Children will not sit still unless they have something to read or watch that is interesting and appealing to them. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should teach lessons. I believe that libraries should have books, magazines, etc., that teach them how to tie their shoes, to count, or to say the alphabet. Children love to sing, so simply put a @CAPS3 in that sings the alphabet, and the child will be singing along shortly. When a child pulls a book off of the shelf at a library, that shows a pretty picture, the child will be attracted to it, and learn as they read or watch. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be offensive. Kids should not read a book, magazine, etc., if the author is talking about harming someone or something. If the book, magazine, etc., has inappropriate language or insult someone, that book needs to be taken off of the shelf and immediately thrown in the trash. The last thing a parent wants is their child to learn something bad from a book and repeat it at school, because that will only lead up to the child getting in serious trouble. Again, I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be banned from the shelves if they are found offensive. Parents do not want to get a phone call from the schoool principal saying their child is using inappropriate language, or being offensive to others. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell wonderful stories, should teach children things that will help them in school, and should not say harmful things about someone or something. Children can learn so much from books, music, movies, magazines, etc., so why make them say offensive or disrespectful things?\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 340:\n","Essay Text: the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the think they learn from reading historical text, and getting outher peoples opinions on things.

In many cases libraries have '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' in which books, that the majority of people would consider explicit, are held. These @CAPS2 are normally closed off and a person has to exert some sort of physical motion through a barrier in order to enter, therefore they are in full knowledge that there @MONTH1 be offensive literature there. One also must take into account the meaning of the term '@CAPS3 @CAPS4'. That term has a key phrase in the title, @CAPS3, which is almost a warning in itself that the literature in it @MONTH1 be offensive to someone. These points show that there should be no restriction on the books, magazines or music in @CAPS3 libraries. The first topic of discussion is the definition of obscene. There are @NUM1 billion people, in the @LOCATION1 alone, that all have their own views of what they consider obscene to be. If one asked an avid conservative their thoughts on obscenity, they would differ by a tremendous amount of those that a free-spirited individual would have. The inconsistency of views is an obvious reason to keep all types of books in libraries. Not only that but also the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 allows libraries to put grossly obscene literature in a hidden, but accessible area. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are made for one purpose, to sheild the general @CAPS3 of things that would be seen by the majority as obscene. These @CAPS2 are not out in the open where anyone can stumble upon them, they are usually in a corner of the @CAPS4, closed off, and marked '@CAPS1'. These @CAPS2 allow a little bit of compromise between the two sides of the debate for censorship, by still allowing all types of literature, but also sheilding anyone from seeing or hearing any of it unpurposefully. Because of these @CAPS2 there is no way anyone could complain about obscenity in the general @CAPS4 setting. For the libraries without @CAPS1 @CAPS2, there is the warning on the door of the @CAPS4, the word @CAPS3. @CAPS3 libraries are intended for the @CAPS3. Walking into one, under ones own power, dispells any complaints one would have about obscenity. This is because the act of entering a @CAPS3 @CAPS4, puts one in the atmosphere of the @CAPS4, whatever it @MONTH1 be. Libraries should not be held responsible for whether or not the literature on their shelves is offensive. The word @CAPS3 in the term @CAPS3 @CAPS4 is, like said previously, a warning of its own, letting anyone know who is entering that there is a chance there @MONTH1 be some things that person could precieve as obscene. This and multiple other reasons put to rest any thought one would have about removing certain literature from libraries. The three reasons given, along with the many more out there left unsaid, make it inevitable that libraries are not ment to be censored. The fact that the word obscene can not be tailored to fit everyone's personal views, the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and the word @CAPS3 placed infront of @CAPS4, warning everyone any type of literature could be in said @CAPS4, are enough to disspell any thought of censoring libraries. Underground bunkers were designed to sheild and censor the @CAPS3, not libraries.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 342:\n","Essay Text: the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the tell about one of my personal experiences with something like this.

At a young age we are taught right from wrong. Everyone has different rights and many different wrongs, that they are taught by their parents. It is those morals we our taught that help us decide what we should listen to or what we shoud read. I am a high school student that is very aware of right or wrong. Though my choices @MONTH1 not show as much. I am very aware of what I read and put into my head. Who wants to have certain magazine sex stories in their head? Not me, thats for sure! That makes any guy a perverse guy. I don't read books the tell me how to get in a girl's pants, that is wrong and I belive that should be censored. As a high school guy looking at a girl can be tough on some and then deciding to read about how to get a girl only encourages those types of attitudes. It is the exact same for girls too. Reading wrong stuff puts it into your head. What goes in your head comes out. Music is very influential in todays world. Rap for instence talks about money, sex, and drugs. Like I said garbage in is garbage out. Rap does have a good side too, all music does it is just an example. Then you have rockstars that do the exact same thing. All music depending on the genre you listen to, does say a lot about the person he/ or she is. Christen music does not need to be censored, because it is positive and up-lifting. Not all songs on the radio need to be censored either. Yes the ones talking about sex, drugs, and other terrible things need to be censored. Why would you want to put that stuff in your head? It makes no sense if that is who you want to be, a unintellegent person that no one likes, due to your moods. Movies could do without all the vulgar language and the sex scenes. Movies are meant to be enjoyed. Movies recently have not been family oriented. Transformers for example is a go out with your friends movie. The @CAPS1 series should never have been created. The person that made the @CAPS1 series has a very dark and twisted mind. Scary movies have a purpose for @CAPS3 and other festivities. Scary or not it should have less sex scenes. You should not have to worry what your child is going to see if he/ or she goes out to the movies with friends. Movies play a big part in our economy and that means many adults, teenagers, and children our watching something that is or is not good for their mind and well-being, but movies still have positive impact, jsut depends on what your watching. It is very obvious that our society has different views on, if things should be censored or not. People have their own lifes to lead and live, it is their right to decide what is right and what is wrong. Books, music, and movies influence our society in many ways. Yes some things need to be censored, because music and movies are making some things socially acceptable. When growing up not all things are socially acceptable, or so we are taught. Schools should not censor many books or our music selections, because it is high school it is when we discover ourselves. It is the morals that we are taught that define us, and what we learn from those morals of what is right or wrong to; read, listen to, or watch, that is what builds us as people to grow. You put garbage in your morals with what you do, you are only going to get garbage out\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 344:\n","Essay Text: the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the many people find too innappropriate for freshman to be reading about. However, it seems to me that we are exposed to offensive things every day and it is not plausible to simply censor every innappropriate thing we come across. In terms of censorship in libraries, it is outlandish to think that we could do the same thing. When people visit libraries, they are there to check out books that they want to read. While there @MONTH1 be many forms of offensive media avaliable to the public through the library, that doesn't mean that people are obligated to view them. We are all perfectly capable of choosing for ourselves what we put into our minds. Because the media advertises offensive things all the time, we cannot block out everything. However we can chose what it is that we want to read when we visit the library. Since it is a choice, it shouldn't be necessary to censor everything there because you don't have to chose to view it. Censorship is also very subjective. What is deemed offensive to someone, @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else. If we oblige to sensor everything anyone claims to be offensive, there would no longer be any forms of media left. This is much like the quote from Katherine Paterson, where she says, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We rid the libraries of what each person finds offensive and what do you have left? Being around things we find offensive is, sadly, a part of life. That does not mean that we have engage in such things. It will never get to a point where everyone is completely happy with the way things are being censored unless everything is done away with, and that would only bring about new issues. We have to have the self control to provide censorship for ourselves, we cannot leave that job to other people.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 345:\n","Essay Text: the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the its amazing you feel like your really their.

They can choose to do that or let the child get the book. I have not personally seen a book that should not be on a shelf in the library, but my mom has told me about something she had seen. My mother had seen a magazine that had said, '@CAPS1! To @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4!' I dont think they should take things like that away because it could be something someone wants to read. If a child sees it then the parent was not paying that good of attention to them. @CAPS3 can be prevented to where it is not a problem. I was in the library not long ago and I found a book that I wanted to read, but my mother seen the cover and the section it was in and she told me to take it back. Someone a little bit older then me picked up the book and checked it out, my mom said you can read that when you get older just not right for your age. So I listened to her and I understand why but do not take it off the shelf, no reason to. There are ways to make sure inappropriate books do not get into childrens hands. If we were to take any book off of the shelf that we did not approve of there would not be any books left, there is always going to be something wrong with every book. Someone always finds something inappropriate. Juat make sure to watch out for those books and nothing will be inappropriate for any age\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 348:\n","Essay Text: the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the like, so taking them away would probably hurt them finantialy.

The people that do like the action or humor or romance books would probably be upset @CAPS3 they took them away.Its also not fair because @CAPS3 takes away what they actually come to the library for in the first place. People that are offended by things always have other places to go to find books and movies and things like that. Not everybody has money to spend on movies. The library is a great place to barrow free movies and books and magazines if you cant afford to buy any. My family didnt have mony to buy any movies so we would go straight to the library to get free ones. Movies now days are very expinsive to jus be buying all the time. In the long run those movie cost are going to add up. Removing everything offensive would really limit the good choices in the library. If you are just left with all the boaring material nobody will come but the ones who got offended. People want the good stuff thats why majority of the folks go. I useally go for the music, books, and movies, but i would just leave if i saw they took all the good choices away. I left the library once because they took away my favorite book, 'A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. I loved that book and they told me they no longer have @CAPS3. I really had no other reason to go other then the music. Then they took all the hip hop away and i just never went any more. So takeing away all the offensive things will jus mess @CAPS3 up for everybody. Not everyone gets offended about small things. If they were to take they were to take them away, @CAPS3 wouldnt be fair, people would lose money they dont have, and @CAPS3 would limit all the good choices. So please dont take anything good out of the library.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 349:\n","Essay Text: the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the book offensive, wouldn't you want that book remove? Having material that is offensive to people in libraries is just plain wrong. The reason I believe that libraries should remove offensive material because, I always see books and movies that are racist toward @CAPS1. Like these qoutes '@CAPS1 are fat and lazy people.''@CAPS1 are border jumpers.''All @CAPS1 are good is farming and cleaning.' @CAPS5 on now, not all @CAPS1 are fat. Some of us have jobs and are tired from working long hours. We are not border jumpers. We have our passports/ green cards.All of these things are offensive and should be removed. I know other @CAPS1 get offended when they see this stuff. Let's say that you're @CAPS8 and you walk into the libray and you see a book all about jokes. You pick up the book and start looking through it and you @CAPS5 across a section about your race. The joke says 'All @CAPS9 are hillbillies.' '@CAPS10, how many @CAPS9 does it take to clean up the house? None because they're dirty so way does it matter.' I know then you would want the library to remove that book. All I'm saying is that having offensive material in the libraries is wrong. They should remove those books, music, movies, and magazines when people complain about them. You wouldn't want your children asking you questions like 'Are we dirty @CAPS9 @CAPS13?' or ' @CAPS14 are we wetbacks?' So yes I believe that those things should be remove from the shelves.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 350:\n","Essay Text: the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the things I would not let my child read or look at. If we don't even give them a chance to see them, then we wouldn't have to worry. Chidren these day are not what they used to be. What would their great grandparents think if they saw the way today's adolescents act, dress, and even talk? Where do you think they get this from? The answer is simple. They get it from today's movies, books, music, and magazines. We cannot keep going on like this or eventually we will have toddlers acting inappropriately! I know from experience that when children are small and they see or hear something, it sticks with them for a long time. If child is looking through a magazine and they see a questionable picture, they are not likely to forget that picture very soon. Or if they are listening to a song with bad words, don't be surprised if they do not forget them or even start repeating them. That is just how small children are. My last point is the fact that parents would probably be much happier if offensive material was removed from libraries. Parents would be able to bring their children to the library and not have to worry about what they are looking at or listening to. The children would feel a sense of freedom and the parents would, in return, feel a sense of reassurance. Offensive material should definitely be removed from our libraries in order to keep our children pure and their parents happy. I understand that others would argue that if we take out offensive material then eventually, there would be nothing left for our children to read. Well, obviously not everything can be censored, but I think a lot of it should be. Censoring material in libraries is definitely the way to go, not just for our children, but also our teenagers\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 351:\n","Essay Text: the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the people from the past and our present, fiction and nonfiction stories and many more.

I do not believe books that some people find offensive should not be taken of shelfs, because they @MONTH1 not be offensive to other people. Books should be seperated by reading levels in libraries. Having a kid, teen and adult section, will help organize a library. This will make it much easier for children to find books that they can actually read. Also if children books are seperated of adult books parents wont find any book offencive to their children. Having books organized by reading levels will make life much easier for a person looking for a certin reading level. Music should be put in to certin catorgies such as rock, jazz, rap or country. Childrens music should be in the kids section along with the books, magazines and movies. Doing this for the children will keep them away from unappriate music, books, maganzies and movies. The music section should not have any bad language in the music that they allow to be checked out. If anyone considered any of the music in the library offensive the library should remove it. Movies should also be seprated by age levels. G, @CAPS2, @NUM1, and @CAPS3 should be the catorgies that the movies should be put into. The only exception should be the childrens movies which should be put into the children section. No one should be allowed to check out a book unless the are old enough for the catorgie they are checking out. This is my view on how libraries should be set up.

These meterials could consist of nude pictures and so on. Most parents do not want to see there kids getting a hold of this type of material. You maybe think 'what could we do about this things, or least come to a compermise to make almost everyone happy. I have so reasons why we should put this type of material away from kids sight and reach. First of all, the books and magizines that have any nude in them, should have their own section and, be labled aduts only. I know this might be alot of work but it is needed, so kids aren't aloud to go in ths section. This will help ruduce what little kids see. There are also books and magizines that are offensive to children of a different race. These books should be removed from the shelves also because they hert peoples feelings, and this might make customers leave your libary. I am not saying ouhae to take ever single book of your selves, but a least reduce the number of books of your selves out of kids eyes mostly and some adults if they are offended. Next thing that comes to mind is the music on compacked discs, or cd's which ever you perfere. In this day and age there are alot of musicians out there that have alot of bad words in their songs. These songs; are songs parents dont like there children to listen to, because parents are afraid of their children here these words and repeating them at home. These type of cd's should be taken of shelves where kids are, and put in a section also labled adults only. I know this wont stop kids from hearing these words and say them, but at least the parents can blame you for their child saying these words, because you did the smart thing and put these cd's out of kids reach. There are songs that are ofensive to people but i know you cant go throught every song and take them off the shelves, but a least take the cd's off the shelve that you know are offensive to people. The last that comes to mind that should be taken off the shelves that are material children shouldnt see is the movies. There are movies out there that are to graphic, to vilent, and to much nudity that kids dont need to see. These type of movies need to also get a section that is for adults only. Then you have the movies that need to just be taking off the shelve because they are to offensive to some viewers. I know that you @MONTH1 say but if it is offensive to them, they dont have to get it. This maybe true but a least move the to a section that those people that get offended dont go. Those were my thoughts on what should be done with material thats to offensive and not aprobriet for eyes or minds.These might be a little extreme but i hope you at least take some of these things into consideration. You cant please all but you can try.

When you enter a library, you don't want to see something that is very offensive. For example, one time my friend and I walked in to the library and the first thing we saw was a book about inappropiate things. We were young so that was the last thing we wanted to see.

I went to the computers to see if my favorite book available. The computer showed that the book was taken off the shelf for offending readers. I checked another list that listed numerous books, music, movies, and magazines that were also taken off of the shelves. Half of the list, I had checked out already. The librarian said the council is voting to take or not take specific books, music, movies, and other items off of the shelves for offensive content. As a regular library customer, I felt I needed to express my opinion of the topic. I believe that before these materials are taken off of the shelves that the librarians need to consider an age limit, a 'three strikes your out' rule, or how much these materials mean to people. Offending people is not what these materials are meant to do. Some books can be perceived in that way which makes the readers angry. I can understand someone's feelings being hurt by a certain topic of reading, but that person @MONTH1 not be mature enough to comprehend what the book is intending as a message. My sister who is the age of ten has read a book which offended her, but she also didn't know what the book really was about. I believe that anyone the age of sixteen or older should be allowed access to these books, music, movies, and magazines. Age sixteeen is when most people are already in high school and more mature. Anyone younger than that shouldn't be allowed access to these items. If the readers are mature enough to handle the material, then people @MONTH1 not be offended as much. Another new rule the library could try is the 'three strikes you're out rule.' @CAPS1 rule is when someone behaves inappropriately. Some people who behave inappropriately will tell everyone the book is offensive and make up stories about the book so their friends will laugh. Each person receives a strike every time they behave inappropriately. @CAPS1 includes in a school classroom as well as the library. After a certain amount of strikes, that person wouldn't be allowed to check out the material. The librarians could keep a record of @CAPS1 which could be accessed whenever. Even if the person is of age to check out the material, they couldn't do so if they had a certain amount of strikes on their record. These materials mean a great deal to people. I am an avid reader as well as movie watcher. When I read a book, I feel like I have freedom. No one is telling me I perceive the book wrong, or that isn't what the character would look like. Reading a book is my own imagination making up the pictures of the story in my head. Taking these items off of the shelves takes away people's immagination. It also takes away from the writers freedom of speech in the @CAPS2 of @CAPS3. The writers wrote their book under that @CAPS2 and now there freedom is basically being taken away from them by taking there speech off of shelves. Overall, I believe that these materials shouldn't be taken off of the shelves. The librarians should consider either making up new rules or thinking about people's opinions of the subject. The librarians should also consider the freedom of speech rule when they are taking these materials off of the shelves. If they don't consider any of these options, then all offensive materials would be taken away. One person could say a book or movie is offensive and it would be taken off of the shelf. After awhile, the library would eventually become empty.

Not everything that people read is going to be nice.Just like everything in the world isn't nice but we deal with it anyways.There's always going to be a really offensive person in the word,but you can't just take them off the shelve becuase that person is mean or you don't like what he's saying.If we killed every offensive person in the world, there would be barely any people left. So i don't agree with taking every book off the shelf that's offensive.There is always going to be something offensive out there in the world,and we can't just get rid of everything that we think needs to go because it's offensive.That would make no sense.Not every thing's nice and sugarcoated,you have to see other parts of the world too,and i think that taking offensive books off the shelf is not the right way to go.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 361:\n","Essay Text: I believe by my beliefs alone, that nothing library be removed from the library just because someone finds the material offensive in anyway possible. So my answer is no, no books, music, movies, magazines should be banned from the library because one person, or mabye the majority of people find it offensive. There is no reason to tarnish anyone elses reading, listening, or watching anything of their interest because others find it offensive. The solution that could solve all this, is for the people that find them offensive, can just completely ignore that material.I can understand by my own experiences how people can find such materials a problem though. For an example, I've read books, listened to music, watched movies, even read magazines that were offensive too me. The biggest problem that occurs in those materials to make them offensive, is usually racism. Most people can deal with it though, so if they can you should be able to, right? As I have stated before, just because you don't like it does not mean that you should disapprove of it. If you disapprove of it and get the material removed from the library then the others who liked it, won't be able to read, listen, nor watch it.The statement I'm making here, is me pretty much saying that onless you only care about yourself, then sure report about it.If you are not a person that only cares of yourself, then you would let the book stay even though you don't like it, because others @MONTH1 like it. My observations of this sort of thing is I've seen people complain how they've read this book, and it was racist towards their well-being. From my own personal readings I've understood that many people have a lot of pride for themselves of who they are and what they are. People need to understand though, it was written by someone else.You @MONTH1 judge, but out of your own respect, should not report to remove of something for their ideas.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 362:\n","Essay Text: Here is what I think about materials being removed library the shelves if they are offensive. I think that some people have different things they like to read and listen to. Someone might like a certain type of book, and another might think it's offensive. So what do you do about this situation? Yes, there might be some books that could be offensive to people if they are about certain things. What if a little kid is in the adult area looking at books and they find a book they shouldn't have seen? Well most parents would want those books to be removed from the library. There could also be books that are just offensive to adults because of what they are about. I've seen people at my library get offended by something they read and they didn't want it back on the shelf. What if there are some @CAPS1's that a little kid checks out and it has language in the music? I don't think that any of that music should be in the library at all. Especially with little kids roaming the library. The music in the library could be offensive to other people to. Not just young kids. When you walk into a library usually the first thing you see are magazines. There can be some pretty inapropriate magazines with inapropriate covers. Is this really what you want people looking at? Especially young kids? There are also movies at a library. Yes, most of them are old movies, but some of them are also kids movies. What if one of those old movies had a bad cover on it, or bad language? A lot of movies are also offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3. I think this because, back in the old days there was a lot of racism, and that is still in alot of movies now. There could also be movies against someones religion. That could be very offensive to certain people. Most of this stuff in libraries can be offensive to young kids because of the covers. Some can be offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because of racism. I think that if you have a problem with something that you see on a shelf, you should tell the librarian and see if they will take it off the shelf. You shouldn't have to be offended by something at the library. I think that people should have their rights to get certain materials off of the shelf. Especially if they think it's offensive to them, or anybody else that might happen to see the same thing. Is this really what we want in our libraries is offensive materials?

And why somethings do not need to be sensored at the library. I will help you to understand what young teenagers or younger children should and should not be able to see or borrow from the library. There are somethings that should be kept from the kids eyes. What are some of the movies, books, or magazines that should be hidden from children? This is probably what you are woundering. The first thing that kids should not be allowed to borrow would be movies that have any that is over there age requirement to see at the movie theather. The reason this is so that the teenager or young child does not watch anything that @MONTH1 scary them. Another thing that should not be seen would be the movies that are meant for a mature veiwer meaning an adult viewer. There are a few books that kids should not be able to read until they are an adult. And these books would be the ones that have a harsh backround on past events that happened. Like what happen during a war to a captured soldier or a prisoner of war. And what they to go through during their imprisonment. These are the books that should be hidden from younger childern. There are some movies, books, music, magazines that do not need to be sensored for people to see. Starting with why some movie do not need to be sensored. First is because most movies are funny but have just a little need of maturity. These movies are the ones that have alot of comedy and as most adults know most kids are into the funny movies. So why take away a movie that is something a kid would have a great time watching. There are some books that should probably be read by adults but there are some teenagers that are mature enough to read this stories. Or if they need to learn about a specific topic for school work they should be allowed to read that book. I do not think that any genre or group of music should be sensored. This because music is a way for someone to express themselves without even having to truely say anything. about who they are or what kind of a mood they are in. music does much more then just that though it helps some people vent on there anger or even how sad they @MONTH1 be. But in conclusion I think there are many things that are good but still need to be sensored for most of the young childern and teenagers to be able to see.

I believe they should allow these certain category of books, movies, and magazines to be allowed, however to an extent. Libraries should open up an area for people above the age of @NUM1 to view this material with a special membership. Books and magazines in libraries are, and should be seperated by categories. The books and magazines that could be considered 'highly offensive,' do not belong on the library shelves at all. However, books and magazines that give out informative data with proper conduct should be allowed. If libraries create an area in which peoples' prefrences are to view content over the age of @NUM1, they should be required to have their own membership. In order to even look at material that is uncensored, visitors need a special pass; this way people who get offended by material that is not censored do not have to pass it while inside the library. Many people who do not want to go out and spend @MONEY1 on a movie rental like to go to the library. Libraries should allow movies from the ranges of ratings @CAPS1(@CAPS2) to @CAPS3(@CAPS4) to be on the shelves of the library. Going into a public library should not have any more restrictions that going into a public video store. However, videos that are considered 'pornography,' should not be in any part of the library. Just like in a public video store, libraries should not contain any footage that is considered pornography. Much of the popular music today is considered offensive. The music in libraries can still be the same songs, but they need to have clean content in them. I believe that edited music in libraries is okay under any circumstances. I do not believe that explicit music is okay. People inside the library could be listening to this explicit music before they take it home, while others in the library get offended by it. People overhearing music would not happen often, but we need to make sure it does not happen at all. Overall, material in libraries that could be considered offensive should not be allowed to be viewed except under special memberships that have proof that an individual is over the age of @NUM1. We all need to work together to make sure our libraries stay clean and unoffensive.

Libraries are suppose to have books that everyone can read and learn from, so if they don't have books for everyone the library should'nt be there. I disagree with removing certain material from the library and here is why. First, the reason why i would'nt remove certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc., because the library is a place where people come to learn about new things. Just because one person does'nt like the book does'nt make it right for them to remove it. If people don't wont their children to read the book don't let them go to the library. They go buy their child some good books to read. Also, no one would want to go to a library that does'nt have what they are looking for. That would'nt be a good look for the library, because if someone goes there and find that all the books their looking for is not in and this is the only library in town they would never want to go back there again. Then they would tell moe people about how that library does'nt have anything your looking for in it. Then, the library would get old close down then get knocked down, and in the shot were the library use to be would be a mini mall, food store, ect. so i really don't think it's a good idea to take book off the shelves at the libraries. We need those books because you never know when something can come up and you need that one book that is not there. In conclusion, removing books from the shelves is a bad thing to do.

They talked about how they feel, where you can get them from, and what they looked like. For a minor reading on how to get drugs and use them, that's telling them to much. It is not a good thing to tell kid's so early in their life about drugs because, they are going to get curious about how the drugs feel. When I was told about drugs I was very curious and I wanted to learn more about them. The older and boring we become the more we will want to try the drugs we learned about earlier in our lives.

Libraries should have sections that are age appropriate. That way if a book is too bad in some way then the mature audience would read it and an audience that should be reading children's books would not be in that section.

For someone to take it off a shelf and ruin peoples chances for being able to read that is awful and it should not be allowed.

And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' -@ORGANIZATION1 quote moves mountians with its wisdom. In @ORGANIZATION1 day and age, many of the things we read/see in magazines, movies, the news etc. are considered to be quite offensive to many. Would a mother of a fifteen year old be upset if @CAPS5 found her daughter reading a magazine that stated, 'safe sex is great sex', or a father finding his teenage son watching a movie with pornographic scenes? The answer is no. The magazines, movies, music and books that are being sent out into libraries all over the world are not exactly '@CAPS1 rated' and many adults would be shocked to realize exactly what it is teenagers are viewing; but is it right to then remove everything some one finds to be wrong or offensive? Lets think about religion for a second. Atheists would find the bible to be a lie, maybe even find it offensive. So in turn to be considerate of their beliefs does that make it 'right' to remove the bible from libraries and open access to the public? Think about the novel, 'To @CAPS2 a @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. English scholars around the world will state that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a novel of its time; that it will continue to be read hundreds of years from now at schools around the world. Some though, would find @ORGANIZATION1 book offensive. The word 'nigger' is placed in @ORGANIZATION1 novel many times and is set in a time when slavery is not frowned apon. Just because one parent finds @ORGANIZATION1 book to be offensive does that mean students from all over should no longer be allowed to read it; that @ORGANIZATION1 book should be 'removed from the shelves?' The questions posed here are not simple questions, they require much time and thought. If a survey was posted asking: Should certain materials be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? The outcome would be intangible to think about now, considering people have many different views on the aspect. In reading @ORGANIZATION1 and contemplating the questions asked you will realize that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a black or white concept; there lies a large area of grey in the middle. Something that one @MONTH1 find offensive, another would not; something a teenager views as interesting an adult @MONTH1 view as crude or vulger. Does @ORGANIZATION1 mean that everything would be taken down from the shelves then? Yes. In the quote above by Katherine Paterson, @CAPS5 states, '.. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS5 is correct in @ORGANIZATION1 because @CAPS5 realizes that everyone has different views on what is appropriate or not. @ORGANIZATION1 statement shows that although libraries @MONTH1 allow inappropriate novels, magazines, tapes etc. to be open to the easy access of customers there is no way that they would be able to make everyone feel content without completely wiping out the building of its contents.

I'll begin by asking; what is censorship? Think about that question while you're reading, or stop and library a moment before you continue. I hope what I have to say will give you a clear idea or a new perspective, and that you might understand what I think the importance of censorship in libraries really means, and not just to me, but to all who pick up a book. To answer my previous question, censoring is the removing of suggestive or otherwise offensive materials from any or all sources of information, or entertainment. Now I'll ask another question; why do we have censorship? Most believe that all children have a right to know things they'll learn about eventually whether or not they want to, and therefore don't care when their children are exposed to that knowledge. Those people don't consider the consequences of that knowledge in the wrong hands, or wrong minds. Children don't think on the same track that most adults do, and therefore are incapable of handling certain knowledges that adults have long since known and otherwise dealt with. Those who know of the consequences of certain knowledges in the wrong minds have tried to keep the information from those who can't or shouldn't worry about them untill they're older and more capable of understanding what it all means. A lot of ideas we have @DATE1, from science and technology, from philosophical thinking to common sense, most everything has been written down in the past, or is being written @DATE1. That's where the problems arise. Almost everything is written about or recorded in some way, therefore increasing the chances that someone will hear or see this knowledge and, not knowing it's importance, might even abuse it eventually. Think about the crimes that go on @DATE1. Are all of them simple? Do they all focus on the same things? How do they come about? All these questions are able to be answered in the simplest ways; the people who commited them learned about something too early in life and grew up thinking it was ok, whether they learned it from books, or music, or movies, etc., and eventually repeated these things they learned. Of course that's not always the case, but for those people who don't know why so many people ended up as the people who get thrown into jail, or get into trouble, a major factor is what they learn at an early age, and not having sensible people to help them to know what's right and what's wrong. To conclude, I think the best ways to avoid the wrong information getting into the wrong hands, is to have censorship in libraries. Without it, people can just walk up to any shelf and pick up that one book, even a nine-year-old child.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 380:\n","Essay Text: Some books, music, movies, and magazines or other types of information or entertanment are innapropriate. I dont believe that they should be removed from the library or library puplic places for that reason though. You have to take a lot into conciteration before decideing weather it should be censored or not. Age is one aspect. If the material is not sutable to a sertain age then it should be organized into a different age category according to the library. I believe that there should be age limits like the ones they have on movies or video games. Rescently there was a book, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, that was questioned on the use of language in it. I think that the author wrote their book the way they want it and would like it sold that way not have it censored. If you find something offensive that doesen't mean you should keep getting involved with it. If there is a book or movie that is offfensive to you, you can stop reading or stop watching it at your own will. Often on the radio there are songs that use innapropriate language and it is bleeped out. Why should we bleep it? Some people could find it more offensive to hear it bleeped than to hear the words just said. And thier oppinion should be the one that counts. The questin weather there should be censorship in libraries is all about a persons perspecitve. Someone is always going to see it differently than you. There is nothing bad about that. I remember watching a show one time and there were these characters in a book club and they were debateing the book its self. Not always is everyone going to like your oppinion of something but you shouldn't despise people for that. I believe that the libraries should not have to use censorship when we have lived as humans long enough to be able to make a decision for ourselves. We should stop being told what to do by rules and laws all the time and have our oppinions heard.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 381:\n","Essay Text: I believe that our libraries should stay the same as they have always been.

I never even heard of a problem in the libraries about things offending people before but sometimes people just need to grow up. There's a certain point to where yeah things should not be writen or films that should'nt have been made but if you dont like it, then dont read it and or watch it. People all have a right to the libraries. Nobody forces anyone to read or watch something, its by the readers choice. Theres no sence in ruining many peoples enjoyment just because a selected few people dont like something. Thats like the @ORGANIZATION2 not having any football just because the players feel like they dont get payed enough @MONEY1 to play it. Taking books and magazines off the library shelves is like the @ORGANIZATION2 locking out everything. Just because a few people arent happy, doesnt mean that everything should be taking out so others cant enjoy it. Why even have a library if your going to change everything because people get offended. Is @ORGANIZATION1 going to stop carrying penuts because some people are allergic to them? No. If people dont like something they have the choice to buy or take it if they want to or not. Its a simple fact that some things should just be left alone. People are all different. Its going to take a long time for people to figure that out. In fact, people @MONTH1 never figure that out. So in my opionion I believe that the libraries can carry anything they want as long as it is appropreit. My thinking is that it will be best if we keep libraries the way they are.

Imagine a little girl about the age of four walking through differnce sections of books in a library when she finds a book that cacthes her eye in the library section. The book is baby blue and has a little bird on it. However, the book also has a half naked man on cover besided the cute little bird. The girl grabs the book and goes happly to find her mom. When the mom looks at the book her face is in shock. What would you do if that was your daughter? Most likely we'd put the book back and explain why she can't have it. While, others would go screaming to the check out and asking, 'how is it possible that my daughter got this? Shouldn't the libraries be wacthing the kids to make sure they don't go in that section?'. I believe that certain materials, such as books,movies, ect., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact people will still find way to get the removed material and that it's just a part of life. My first reason that certain materials, such as books, shouldn't be pulled from are shelves is that we live in a nation that prides it's self as the '@CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. That doesn't mean we get everything for @CAPS2 when we go to a store it just simple means that you, the people of @LOCATION1, have the freedom and right to speak your mind. So you can say whatever you want in newspapers or in books because the government gives you that right. However, you can't say 'I have a bomb' at the airports because of the many attacks the nation has encountered over the years, but that's common sences. My second reason that certain materials should say on the put, even if someone is offened by it is that no matter how many books or movies you take of the store shelves, the people will find a way to get them. One way to get them is the black market where people sell drugs and weapons. Do we, as a country really need another drug on the market even if it's a book? I think not. Also, if you look at the whole picture people will be losing jobs because the televison today is not the kind they had back in your grandma's day. Nearly @PERCENT1 of everything on televison has something to do with the little three letter s-word every parent hates to talk about. You might be thinking that if we take the unrated movies and the books with the naked men on the cover we'd be saving are children which leads me to my last point. Seeing unrated movies and such is a part of life. So what are you saving them from? Children sooner or later will grow up and learn about the types of subject matter so why take it off when you will have to teach them about it sooner rather then later? Millions of parents around the @CAPS3 each and every year have to teach their kids about the birds and the bees. It's a part of growing up in a way. Now a days though, the birds and the bees are all people seem to talk about. So like it or not your kids will find out just like you did and your parents before you. Plus, your not going to make everyone happy. Someone will always be offened by something. Imagine. Imagine that same little girl, now an adult, having to deal with that same issue of the same baby blue book with the same little bird with the half naked man on the cover. The truth is that this way my mother when she was little and it turns out that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree because I had the same issue as well. I know that one day I will also have the same issue as my mother did before me. So I believe that certain materials, such as books and movies, shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact that people will still find a way to get the removed material and that it's just apart of life.

The media should be for everyone to enjoy and not have to worry about offensive material. In @DATE1's world there are offensive media out there and they often start up problems. We need to do something about this problem. If there are offensive media out there the kids of the future are going to look up to them and try to be like them or hate the same thing that the media does. Let's just say there was a song about school and how people dont like it don't you think our kids are going to hate school too? I don't think that is right. We need to teach our kids that school is very important and not to take in what the media says because they are not always right. We want enjoyable media in the world. We want good things for our future kids to see and hear. We don't want kids picking up bad words. We need to watch what we put out in the world. If there is something offensive remove it from the shelves as soon as possible or just not put it out to the public at all. Offensive media can often start up problems in the world.

If a book talks about how bad a certain race is those people that were disliked in the book are going to get even with the people who made the book or other media. Many issues @DATE1 are over media out there in the world. People that work at libraries should keep an eye out for offensive materals and shoud remove them to prevent even more problems. I'm sure libraries all around the world have some kind of offensive media in it. We need to stand up and fight to get rid of all offensive media and make the world a better place.

Truth be told, there are many ways for our offspring to not have the availability of those books. There is what I believe to be an appropriate division on the materials in our libraries and bookstores, the fact that we can always monitor what our children read and watch, and not to mention that we can use the internet to back up any doubts we have on the literature and lyrics.The question that remains is: Are we using the ways of preventing this problem to the best of our abilities? I believe that our public libraries and bookstores do a splendid job of diviying up what is deemed appropriate for each age group. Teens know a fairly good amount more about things than all parents invision they shouldn't, and I think the bookstores and libraries keep the youths knowledge in what they're listening, watching, and reading to what these kids already know. Comparing what is considered a 'young adult' book and an 'adult' book, you will find an atrocious difference. Young adult books only hint around things such as drugs, refraining from abstinence, and grisly murder scenes whereas adult books go into a great deal more detail. Middle school level children's books are even more less detailed than teen books, so it is save to say that as long as the parents are directing their child into the appropriate section in anyone's given local library, they will be in good hands. There's also the option of monitering what our young ones are listening to. By simply being interested in what it is that the child is singing or humming along to, us parents would find that they wouldn't be reluctant to let on about what was being said. If in any case we feel that the lyrics are too harsh for the kid, we are still their parents and have the right to deem it as something they shouldn't be listening to and suggest something different to them and/or ban them from being able to listen. In @CAPS1 cases though, we should try to listen to what our kids are. In this way, we can be reassured that the range of materials they're plugging into their ears are not what we would consider to be grotesque for something our children's age. Another useful tool would have to be the internet. If we don't feel the need to ask about the literature or music, but @MONTH1 still have a few doubts, there are plenty of book and music blogs across the world wide web that can help us out. Even by going to a bookstore website and reading the description about the book, or a lyric website that will tell us what is being said, or even a movie website where we can see a rating and the content of the movie, and the comments left by people that go with it respectively, @CAPS1 of us would find all of the information we need. Even author's, director's, and artist's websites would be useful. Looking at their discussions would be a big help as well, considering that @CAPS1 of these people have a vision of what age groups would be attracted to their material. In conclusion, I think our children are fairly wise about what they choose to read, listen to, and watch, but then again, it all depends on the preference. Not every child is the same, just as not any adult, or any one person. The prefernce tends to lean towards the things we think are appropriate. Paying attention to what the young ones are like says alot about what they read, and what they listen to and watch, for that matter. We have all these ways of keeping our children from reading, watching and listening to inappropriate things, we just have to make them and asset\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 386:\n","Essay Text: For many years libraries have had books, magazines, and movies posted in their shelves of the library that are very offensive to many people. Many people ask how is it ok for that library to be open to teenagers and possibly children. In my opinion I think that it is not right for libraries not to do anything about this problem, especially when this is happening across the nation. In large department stores such as @ORGANIZATION1, you are required to be eighteen years old to purchase adult items, sometimes you must be twenty-one years of age. It is considered illegal for anyone under the required age to purchase an item with an age limit on it. Music is a totally different type of profanity, @CAPS1 albums are sold with much innapropiate material in them that is open to the public, but the @CAPS1's sold in stores are usually edited into a more appropiate version. Days like today nearly no one ever buys @CAPS1's anymore, its all about @CAPS4's and @NUM1's where all you have to do is find your song on a site and download it for free in about four to five seconds. It would not surprise me if libraries had music and @CAPS1's with just as much adult profanity, and language that is not edited out. So if most of the things in this world that are adult rated and can not be purchased unless your considered an adult by age, why should it be ok to viewed by any age in a library. I myself believe that it should be illegal for materials such as the ones mentioned to be banned or atleast taken more respected with the viewer of the materials. It would really hurt a parent for them to take a kid to a library and tell them to go find a book they like, and they return to their mother or father with an adult book with many things a child or possibly a teenager should not see. I believe times like those could tear a parent or even a grandparent apart, having to explain to their children or grandchildren what they just saw. Because most of us know that most children always want to know what something is when they see it, and for a parent to have to explain to their child at that age has to be heart-stopping. In all of this that I have explained is only my opinion, but I believe many other millions of people agree with me. If it is not aloud almost everywhere else in this world, why should it be ok a library to do it? Is it because its some little rule about freedom of decision? Do libraries think just because they are old fashioned and have been here longer than the @CAPS1's, @CAPS4's, and @NUM1's that they dont have to follow rules and guidelines. It is a shame that they are ruining the lives and visions of the children and teens today to think its ok for anyone to see, listen, or watch these materials.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 387:\n","Essay Text: There are many books in the libraries.

I say no that the books, music, movies, or magazines should not be removed from libraries, because if the books or etc. are that offensive, those things shouldn't library in childrens reach anyway. There should be a section limit where children can't go by to get to the offensive type books and others. Why take things that older people would insist on looking at off the shelf just because someone didn't separate the adult books and etc., from the childrens. Taking away the things that adults look at would be just as bad as taking the things that children or teens would like such as the music and movies, even though the music sometimes influnce some children to do bad or get off track from being who they really are. I don't understand why take those type things down when you are getting benefits off the things that people buy that will help keep libraries open such as fun rasier type. If you don't have things in a library that will capture a young persons attention like the movies, music, or magazines then children or teens will not be interested on going to libraries. Adults nor teens will sit in a library with under age books, movies, or music. Reason being is, becuase they are muture and not exactly looking for a book with lots of pictures and cartoons unless they are reading to an under age sibling. When that child has to go to library with his or her parent for example to do a project that parent would rather not just sit and wait the whole time for his or her child to finish. That is where the magazines come in ; magazines are very interesting books such as @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS2 @CAPS3 those magazines occupy peoples time while they are waiting just like any other places. Everywhere you go children are going to see things that they shouldn't see at their age, because television and the internet has so many componets that will cause a distraction to a childs mind that will make them question everything they see. That child will soon have to learn. That is how most children are becoming so blunt with the things they do or say, because either they seen it or heard it. I know you @MONTH1 think that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves to keep out of reach of children, but I think that if you are able to separate all upper age group books, movies, music, magazines from all children and other young adults, the library would become more beneficial to everyone that has access to a local library.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 389:\n","Essay Text: I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.

Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories, should teach lessons, and should not be offensive. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories. When I sit down to read a book or magazine, or to watch a movie, I want to read or watch an interesting story. A little child is not going to want to read a book about history or science, they will want to read about @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @LOCATION2, or @ORGANIZATION1. Children will not sit still unless they have something to read or watch that is interesting and appealing to them. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should teach lessons. I believe that libraries should have books, magazines, etc., that teach them how to tie their shoes, to count, or to say the alphabet. Children love to sing, so simply put a @CAPS3 in that sings the alphabet, and the child will be singing along shortly. When a child pulls a book off of the shelf at a library, that shows a pretty picture, the child will be attracted to it, and learn as they read or watch. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be offensive. Kids should not read a book, magazine, etc., if the author is talking about harming someone or something. If the book, magazine, etc., has inappropriate language or insult someone, that book needs to be taken off of the shelf and immediately thrown in the trash. The last thing a parent wants is their child to learn something bad from a book and repeat it at school, because that will only lead up to the child getting in serious trouble.

There are just to many views on what is explicit to discern between library should be allowed, and what should be expunged. In many cases libraries have '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' in which books, that the majority of people would consider explicit, are held. These @CAPS2 are normally closed off and a person has to exert some sort of physical motion through a barrier in order to enter, therefore they are in full knowledge that there @MONTH1 be offensive literature there. One also must take into account the meaning of the term '@CAPS3 @CAPS4'. That term has a key phrase in the title, @CAPS3, which is almost a warning in itself that the literature in it @MONTH1 be offensive to someone. These points show that there should be no restriction on the books, magazines or music in @CAPS3 libraries. The first topic of discussion is the definition of obscene. There are @NUM1 billion people, in the @LOCATION1 alone, that all have their own views of what they consider obscene to be. If one asked an avid conservative their thoughts on obscenity, they would differ by a tremendous amount of those that a free-spirited individual would have. The inconsistency of views is an obvious reason to keep all types of books in libraries. Not only that but also the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 allows libraries to put grossly obscene literature in a hidden, but accessible area. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are made for one purpose, to sheild the general @CAPS3 of things that would be seen by the majority as obscene. These @CAPS2 are not out in the open where anyone can stumble upon them, they are usually in a corner of the @CAPS4, closed off, and marked '@CAPS1'. These @CAPS2 allow a little bit of compromise between the two sides of the debate for censorship, by still allowing all types of literature, but also sheilding anyone from seeing or hearing any of it unpurposefully. Because of these @CAPS2 there is no way anyone could complain about obscenity in the general @CAPS4 setting. For the libraries without @CAPS1 @CAPS2, there is the warning on the door of the @CAPS4, the word @CAPS3. @CAPS3 libraries are intended for the @CAPS3. Walking into one, under ones own power, dispells any complaints one would have about obscenity. This is because the act of entering a @CAPS3 @CAPS4, puts one in the atmosphere of the @CAPS4, whatever it @MONTH1 be. Libraries should not be held responsible for whether or not the literature on their shelves is offensive. The word @CAPS3 in the term @CAPS3 @CAPS4 is, like said previously, a warning of its own, letting anyone know who is entering that there is a chance there @MONTH1 be some things that person could precieve as obscene. This and multiple other reasons put to rest any thought one would have about removing certain literature from libraries. The three reasons given, along with the many more out there left unsaid, make it inevitable that libraries are not ment to be censored. The fact that the word obscene can not be tailored to fit everyone's personal views, the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and the word @CAPS3 placed infront of @CAPS4, warning everyone any type of literature could be in said @CAPS4, are enough to disspell any thought of censoring libraries. Underground bunkers were designed to sheild and censor the @CAPS3, not libraries.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 392:\n","Essay Text: Bad @CAPS1 Should be Removed I think that they schould be taken off of the shelves in libraries.

The reason I think @CAPS1 like this should be taken off of the shelves, is because of little kids coming in and taking them off of the shelves and looking at @CAPS1, that aren't apporate for little childern to see. And older kids looking at them and getting some ideas from them and going home and doing them. Which could cause harm of even death. A personal experience with something like this when I was in fourth grade. Is I went to my teachers bookshelf and picked out a book to take home. That night when I got home I asked my mom if she colud read it to me before I went to bed. So she did and when she opened the book it had alot of bad words in it. That are bad for little childeren to hear. So she to it to the principal the next day and showed it to him and he fired the teacher for having the book on the shelves.

Absolutely, there are many books, magazines, and music selections that should have never reached the shelf. Life has many choices. The people of this world have a choice on what they read or library to. At a young age we are taught right from wrong. Everyone has different rights and many different wrongs, that they are taught by their parents. It is those morals we our taught that help us decide what we should listen to or what we shoud read. I am a high school student that is very aware of right or wrong. Though my choices @MONTH1 not show as much. I am very aware of what I read and put into my head. Who wants to have certain magazine sex stories in their head? Not me, thats for sure! That makes any guy a perverse guy. I don't read books the tell me how to get in a girl's pants, that is wrong and I belive that should be censored. As a high school guy looking at a girl can be tough on some and then deciding to read about how to get a girl only encourages those types of attitudes. It is the exact same for girls too. Reading wrong stuff puts it into your head. What goes in your head comes out. Music is very influential in todays world. Rap for instence talks about money, sex, and drugs. Like I said garbage in is garbage out. Rap does have a good side too, all music does it is just an example. Then you have rockstars that do the exact same thing. All music depending on the genre you listen to, does say a lot about the person he/ or she is. Christen music does not need to be censored, because it is positive and up-lifting. Not all songs on the radio need to be censored either. Yes the ones talking about sex, drugs, and other terrible things need to be censored. Why would you want to put that stuff in your head? It makes no sense if that is who you want to be, a unintellegent person that no one likes, due to your moods. Movies could do without all the vulgar language and the sex scenes. Movies are meant to be enjoyed. Movies recently have not been family oriented. Transformers for example is a go out with your friends movie. The @CAPS1 series should never have been created. The person that made the @CAPS1 series has a very dark and twisted mind. Scary movies have a purpose for @CAPS3 and other festivities. Scary or not it should have less sex scenes. You should not have to worry what your child is going to see if he/ or she goes out to the movies with friends. Movies play a big part in our economy and that means many adults, teenagers, and children our watching something that is or is not good for their mind and well-being, but movies still have positive impact, jsut depends on what your watching. It is very obvious that our society has different views on, if things should be censored or not. People have their own lifes to lead and live, it is their right to decide what is right and what is wrong. Books, music, and movies influence our society in many ways. Yes some things need to be censored, because music and movies are making some things socially acceptable. When growing up not all things are socially acceptable, or so we are taught. Schools should not censor many books or our music selections, because it is high school it is when we discover ourselves. It is the morals that we are taught that define us, and what we learn from those morals of what is right or wrong to; read, listen to, or watch, that is what builds us as people to grow. You put garbage in your morals with what you do, you are only going to get garbage out\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 394:\n","Essay Text: During my freshman year there was a lot of controversy over whether or not the classes should be allowed to read 'The @ORGANIZATION1' in school. The debate was due to the fact that there is a rape scene in the book, library many people find too innappropriate for freshman to be reading about. However, it seems to me that we are exposed to offensive things every day and it is not plausible to simply censor every innappropriate thing we come across. In terms of censorship in libraries, it is outlandish to think that we could do the same thing. When people visit libraries, they are there to check out books that they want to read. While there @MONTH1 be many forms of offensive media avaliable to the public through the library, that doesn't mean that people are obligated to view them. We are all perfectly capable of choosing for ourselves what we put into our minds. Because the media advertises offensive things all the time, we cannot block out everything. However we can chose what it is that we want to read when we visit the library. Since it is a choice, it shouldn't be necessary to censor everything there because you don't have to chose to view it. Censorship is also very subjective. What is deemed offensive to someone, @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else. If we oblige to sensor everything anyone claims to be offensive, there would no longer be any forms of media left. This is much like the quote from Katherine Paterson, where she says, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We rid the libraries of what each person finds offensive and what do you have left? Being around things we find offensive is, sadly, a part of life. That does not mean that we have engage in such things. It will never get to a point where everyone is completely happy with the way things are being censored unless everything is done away with, and that would only bring about new issues. We have to have the self control to provide censorship for ourselves, we cannot leave that job to other people.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 395:\n","Essay Text: I believe, an artist has the rights to his/her music being sold.

But in the long run they will realize you made those choices for them is cause you cared. So personally I really don't think its the music's fault or movies,magazines,etc. I think its the way those kids are rised in their household, that impacts the choices they make. Heres an example, I saw this really awesome video game that I wanted once. But my dad said no. Cause its language and themes were bad. At first I thought I hated my dad. But now I'm glad I didn't buy it. Cause what good would a video game do in the long run. Will it pay bills? No it won't. Will it bring food to the table? No it won't. Will it help you get married? No I think not. The point is the choices made now is what is going to effect you in the long run. I really think its choice. If you make the choice of buying a movie or book,music etc.With that kind of offensive behavior. Then, thats how your representing youself to others around you.

It all just depends on what the people in the library like. Taking a library book off of the shelf might be inappropriate for younger kids can kind of be wrong. Just for the simple fact that it @MONTH1 not be inappropriate for adults and it could be something that they would like to read.

The library is a great place to barrow free movies and books and magazines if you cant afford to buy any.

Absolutely! I believe we should, at least for the children. There are some pretty bad things out there that I do not believe are quite appropriate for children, or even teenagers. If I were a parent, there are library things I would not let my child read or look at. If we don't even give them a chance to see them, then we wouldn't have to worry. Chidren these day are not what they used to be. What would their great grandparents think if they saw the way today's adolescents act, dress, and even talk? Where do you think they get this from? The answer is simple. They get it from today's movies, books, music, and magazines. We cannot keep going on like this or eventually we will have toddlers acting inappropriately! I know from experience that when children are small and they see or hear something, it sticks with them for a long time. If child is looking through a magazine and they see a questionable picture, they are not likely to forget that picture very soon. Or if they are listening to a song with bad words, don't be surprised if they do not forget them or even start repeating them. That is just how small children are. My last point is the fact that parents would probably be much happier if offensive material was removed from libraries. Parents would be able to bring their children to the library and not have to worry about what they are looking at or listening to. The children would feel a sense of freedom and the parents would, in return, feel a sense of reassurance. Offensive material should definitely be removed from our libraries in order to keep our children pure and their parents happy. I understand that others would argue that if we take out offensive material then eventually, there would be nothing left for our children to read.

I know this might be alot of work but it is needed, so kids aren't aloud to go in ths section. This will help ruduce what little kids see. There are also books and magizines that are offensive to children of a different race. These books should be removed from the shelves also because they hert peoples feelings, and this might make customers leave your libary. I am not saying ouhae to take ever single book of your selves, but a least reduce the number of books of your selves out of kids eyes mostly and some adults if they are offended. Next thing that comes to mind is the music on compacked discs, or cd's which ever you perfere. In this day and age there are alot of musicians out there that have alot of bad words in their songs. These songs; are songs parents dont like there children to listen to, because parents are afraid of their children here these words and repeating them at home. These type of cd's should be taken of shelves where kids are, and put in a section also labled adults only. I know this wont stop kids from hearing these words and say them, but at least the parents can blame you for their child saying these words, because you did the smart thing and put these cd's out of kids reach. There are songs that are ofensive to people but i know you cant go throught every song and take them off the shelves, but a least take the cd's off the shelve that you know are offensive to people. The last that comes to mind that should be taken off the shelves that are material children shouldnt see is the movies. There are movies out there that are to graphic, to vilent, and to much nudity that kids dont need to see. These type of movies need to also get a section that is for adults only. Then you have the movies that need to just be taking off the shelve because they are to offensive to some viewers. I know that you @MONTH1 say but if it is offensive to them, they dont have to get it. This maybe true but a least move the to a section that those people that get offended dont go. Those were my thoughts on what should be done with material thats to offensive and not aprobriet for eyes or minds.These might be a little extreme but i hope you at least take some of these things into consideration. You cant please all but you can try. Thanks for reading this and i hope it as changed your thoughts on material thats bad for kids to see\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 404:\n","Essay Text: I censorship believe that there are some materials that should not be allowed on the shevles. There are things in this world that kids should not see for a long time. If there are things that are offensive on the shelves, then kids can read it and it could lead to bad things. When you enter a library, you don't want to see something that is very offensive. For example, one time my friend and I walked in to the library and the first thing we saw was a book about inappropiate things. We were young so that was the last thing we wanted to see. It was a horrible thing to see and I feel that no child should have to see that when they go into a library. You can never unsee things. No parent wants their children going into a library and reading things they shouldn't. It @MONTH1 have an affect on their childrens behavior and future. If a child went into a library and began reading a book about drugs it could hurt their future. If the book was telling them that drugs aren't always bad, then that kid @MONTH1 grow up thinking it is okay to do drugs. This could really ruin someones life. I know that this @MONTH1 not always be true,but it could be in some cases. If I was to walk into a library today, there probably wouldn't be to many things found offensive. I feel that as the years go on, there are less inappropriate things found on the shelves at libraries because people ask them to remove the book if it is offensive. If I was to find something bad there I would ask them to remove it from the shelf. I believe that everyone should have the right to remove a book from the shelf if it is offensive. I also think that eveyone would need a good reason to remove it because eventually there wouldn't be very many books left on the shelves. I believe that these are all very good reasons to removes offensive books off the shelves at libraries. I hope that most would agree that no one should have to see these offensive books when they enter a library.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 405:\n","Essay Text: Do you censorship that certain books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves in a library if found offensive?Sometimes they should if found offensive by alot of people.Sometimes books are found offensive by a few people and the books should not be band.

People need to know what happened in the past so they can move on in the future.

These books that are found offensive to some @MONTH1 not be offensive to others, heres an example, lets say there is a recovering alcoholic and this person is flipping through a magazine and they see a alcoholic beverage ad in the magazine. This would be offensive to them but to the person next to him that collects fine wines its not offensive to him. This is all a matter of opinion, another example, there is a magazine that comes in that has a ammo add and one of the librarians finds it bad, but the others like to hunt game and they find it helpful to read an ad about ammounition for their next vacation to alaska. As i said before it is all a sense of oppinions. Its one persons oppinion aganist others and its a never ending cycle, and its never going to stop. Basically this censorship is a game of he said , she said, and it is not fair to the people to take something away just because a few people do not like it. Some people found racial profiling offensive others did not, some people seen what @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was doing was right, others didnt.

Public libraries have the title 'public' for a reason. Taking good books off shelves, that @MONTH1 not be good books for @PERSON1 children, instead should be catagorized in sections for @PERSON1 children, pre-teens, teenagers, and adults. I beleive that censorship of libraries would be a very ignorant idea. Not to mention that it would create an uproar in the public tax payers.

A lot of the public @MONTH1 like those books and other media sources that's being taken away, @CAPS1 some @MONTH1 find the books offensive, but that dosen't mean that they have to get rid of the book, when they can just put the book down. I do beleive that everyone should have a say in their public libraries to improve them, not disprove them. @PERSON1 children should be restricted from the sections that are not appropriate for their age and should be rederected to locations of sections that are appropriate for their age. Censorship on this subject means sealing other ideas off and away from the public eyes.

If people like Paterson are concerned about what @PERSON1 readers can read and uptain, they should be monitering what their children are reading and allow them or not, not the libraries. The libraries just carry the book. Books that are offensive @MONTH1 show the reader new and interesting ideas.

I went to the computers to see if my favorite book available. The computer showed that the book was taken off the shelf for offending readers. I checked another list that listed numerous books, music, movies, and magazines that were also taken off of the shelves. Half of the list, I had checked out already. The librarian said the council is voting to take or not take specific books, music, movies, and other items off of the shelves for offensive content. As a regular library customer, I felt I needed to express my opinion of the topic. I believe that before these materials are taken off of the shelves that the librarians need to consider an age limit, a 'three strikes your out' rule, or how much these materials mean to people. Offending people is not what these materials are meant to do. Some books can be perceived in that way which makes the readers angry. I can understand someone's feelings being hurt by a certain topic of reading, but that person @MONTH1 not be mature enough to comprehend what the book is intending as a message. My sister who is the age of ten has read a book which offended her, but she also didn't know what the book really was about. I believe that anyone the age of sixteen or older should be allowed access to these books, music, movies, and magazines. Age sixteeen is when most people are already in high school and more mature. Anyone younger than that shouldn't be allowed access to these items. If the readers are mature enough to handle the material, then people @MONTH1 not be offended as much. Another new rule the library could try is the 'three strikes you're out rule.' @CAPS1 rule is when someone behaves inappropriately. Some people who behave inappropriately will tell everyone the book is offensive and make up stories about the book so their friends will laugh. Each person receives a strike every time they behave inappropriately. @CAPS1 includes in a school classroom as well as the library. After a certain amount of strikes, that person wouldn't be allowed to check out the material. The librarians could keep a record of @CAPS1 which could be accessed whenever. Even if the person is of age to check out the material, they couldn't do so if they had a certain amount of strikes on their record. These materials mean a great deal to people. I am an avid reader as well as movie watcher. When I read a book, I feel like I have freedom. No one is telling me I perceive the book wrong, or that isn't what the character would look like. Reading a book is my own imagination making up the pictures of the story in my head. Taking these items off of the shelves takes away people's immagination. It also takes away from the writers freedom of speech in the @CAPS2 of @CAPS3. The writers wrote their book under that @CAPS2 and now there freedom is basically being taken away from them by taking there speech off of shelves. Overall, I believe that these materials shouldn't be taken off of the shelves. The librarians should consider either making up new rules or thinking about people's opinions of the subject. The librarians should also consider the freedom of speech rule when they are taking these materials off of the shelves. If they don't consider any of these options, then all offensive materials would be taken away. One person could say a book or movie is offensive and it would be taken off of the shelf. After awhile, the library would eventually become empty.

There is no reason to tarnish anyone elses reading, listening, or watching anything of their interest because others find it offensive. The solution that could solve all this, is for the people that find them offensive, can just completely ignore that material.I can understand by my own experiences how people can find such materials a problem though. For an example, I've read books, listened to music, watched movies, even read magazines that were offensive too me. The biggest problem that occurs in those materials to make them offensive, is usually racism. Most people can deal with it though, so if they can you should be able to, right?

I think that some people have different things they like to read and listen to. Someone might like a certain type of book, and another might think it's offensive. So what do you do about this situation? Yes, there might be some books that could be offensive to people if they are about certain things. What if a little kid is in the adult area looking at books and they find a book they shouldn't have seen? Well most parents would want those books to be removed from the library. There could also be books that are just offensive to adults because of what they are about. I've seen people at my library get offended by something they read and they didn't want it back on the shelf. What if there are some @CAPS1's that a little kid checks out and it has language in the music? I don't think that any of that music should be in the library at all. Especially with little kids roaming the library. The music in the library could be offensive to other people to. Not just young kids. When you walk into a library usually the first thing you see are magazines. There can be some pretty inapropriate magazines with inapropriate covers. Is this really what you want people looking at? Especially young kids? There are also movies at a library. Yes, most of them are old movies, but some of them are also kids movies. What if one of those old movies had a bad cover on it, or bad language? A lot of movies are also offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3. I think this because, back in the old days there was a lot of racism, and that is still in alot of movies now. There could also be movies against someones religion. That could be very offensive to certain people. Most of this stuff in libraries can be offensive to young kids because of the covers. Some can be offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because of racism. I think that if you have a problem with something that you see on a shelf, you should tell the librarian and see if they will take it off the shelf. You shouldn't have to be offended by something at the library. I think that people should have their rights to get certain materials off of the shelf.

And why somethings do not need to be sensored at the library. I will help you to understand what young teenagers or younger children should and should not be able to see or borrow from the library. There are somethings that should be kept from the kids eyes. What are some of the movies, books, or magazines that should be hidden from children? This is probably what you are woundering. The first thing that kids should not be allowed to borrow would be movies that have any that is over there age requirement to see at the movie theather. The reason this is so that the teenager or young child does not watch anything that @MONTH1 scary them. Another thing that should not be seen would be the movies that are meant for a mature veiwer meaning an adult viewer. There are a few books that kids should not be able to read until they are an adult. And these books would be the ones that have a harsh backround on past events that happened. Like what happen during a war to a captured soldier or a prisoner of war. And what they to go through during their imprisonment. These are the books that should be hidden from younger childern. There are some movies, books, music, magazines that do not need to be sensored for people to see. Starting with why some movie do not need to be sensored. First is because most movies are funny but have just a little need of maturity. These movies are the ones that have alot of comedy and as most adults know most kids are into the funny movies. So why take away a movie that is something a kid would have a great time watching. There are some books that should probably be read by adults but there are some teenagers that are mature enough to read this stories. Or if they need to learn about a specific topic for school work they should be allowed to read that book. I do not think that any genre or group of music should be sensored. This because music is a way for someone to express themselves without even having to truely say anything. about who they are or what kind of a mood they are in. music does much more then just that though it helps some people vent on there anger or even how sad they @MONTH1 be.

I believe they should allow these certain category of books, movies, and magazines to be allowed, however to an extent. Libraries should open up an area for people above the age of @NUM1 to view this material with a special membership. Books and magazines in libraries are, and should be seperated by categories. The books and magazines that could be considered 'highly offensive,' do not belong on the library shelves at all. However, books and magazines that give out informative data with proper conduct should be allowed. If libraries create an area in which peoples' prefrences are to view content over the age of @NUM1, they should be required to have their own membership. In order to even look at material that is uncensored, visitors need a special pass; this way people who get offended by material that is not censored do not have to pass it while inside the library. Many people who do not want to go out and spend @MONEY1 on a movie rental like to go to the library. Libraries should allow movies from the ranges of ratings @CAPS1(@CAPS2) to @CAPS3(@CAPS4) to be on the shelves of the library. Going into a public library should not have any more restrictions that going into a public video store. However, videos that are considered 'pornography,' should not be in any part of the library. Just like in a public video store, libraries should not contain any footage that is considered pornography. Much of the popular music today is considered offensive. The music in libraries can still be the same songs, but they need to have clean content in them. I believe that edited music in libraries is okay under any circumstances. I do not believe that explicit music is okay. People inside the library could be listening to this explicit music before they take it home, while others in the library get offended by it. People overhearing music would not happen often, but we need to make sure it does not happen at all. Overall, material in libraries that could be considered offensive should not be allowed to be viewed except under special memberships that have proof that an individual is over the age of @NUM1. We all need to work together to make sure our libraries stay clean and unoffensive. Libraries are some peoples resort to peacefulness, so lets keep it that way, and respect the feelings of others\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 419:\n","Essay Text: Absolutly not this is a free country. It is basically the same thing as freedom of censorship If someone finds the material offensive then they shouldnt read it! Sure im sure libraries in communist countries take books off the shelves, but that's because theyre communist! If you take away freedoms of people then eventually our counrty will become one of those communist countries nobody wants. Why would anyone not be able to read a good book its a story. Music is music no matter what they say in the lyrics, and movies if you get rid of movies well then whats the @LOCATION1 coming to certainly not a free country. I enjoy all kinds of different movies. Lets see I like dramas, comedys, horror, and action movies they're all great! So what if its a little rasict or sextist all its doing is telling a story. Same with music I love songs my favorite genres are hip hop, classic, and country. Books I do not like very much but some people do so you have to keep them. So if you ask me people that want to take books, movies, and music out of libraries to protect people then that means your just trying to protect yourself. Maybe a section in the library should be made saying these books @MONTH1 be offensive to some people. I do agree with that because some people really dont know what theyre about to read, listen to, or watch. So that is my conclution on this topic.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 420:\n","Essay Text: @CAPS4 I do agree on removing offensive or negative books from the shelf. Music, books, magazines, or censorship movies should be atleast vision proof, in other words fix everything so kids can watch or read to. Music, is a very popular trend on the world now. Everybody listens and feed into it, but some music and also lead to problems. You know how most songs can be played and have alof of 'negative' lyrics? Well I believe that can be fix, because not everything you say do not have to be with a vulgar word or end with one. Music is not about '@CAPS1, @CAPS2, or even @CAPS3', music suppose to make you feel good inside or maybe even down in some people cases, but music is a positive fact and people do not suppose to turn something positive into negative. Books are influencional on me because I like to read, I enjoying reading books that I can relate to and understand cause most people can read something and not understand a thing. As little kids we all were tought to pick up a book and read but as we get older we fall off, but what people do not know is, books help develop your reading and vocabulary skills. Even if you read a magazine, anything would help as long as your reading something. Magazines are basically about the world, celebritys and how the media react, but like a book a magazine do not stick with one topic. Movies especially movies are a big deal in the world. If you havent notice what ever kids/teenagers/ and maybe even adults see in movie they eventually going to do it. All movies should be @NUM1 which mean, everybody could see. People fail to realize movies are not reality, what you see in movies you can not do in reality, it might be base on real stuff but its not.

That censorship make someone who really like the book that they took alway upset. Libraries are suppose to have books that everyone can read and learn from, so if they don't have books for everyone the library should'nt be there. I disagree with removing certain material from the library and here is why. First, the reason why i would'nt remove certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc., because the library is a place where people come to learn about new things. Just because one person does'nt like the book does'nt make it right for them to remove it. If people don't wont their children to read the book don't let them go to the library. They go buy their child some good books to read. Also, no one would want to go to a library that does'nt have what they are looking for. That would'nt be a good look for the library, because if someone goes there and find that all the books their looking for is not in and this is the only library in town they would never want to go back there again. Then they would tell moe people about how that library does'nt have anything your looking for in it. Then, the library would get old close down then get knocked down, and in the shot were the library use to be would be a mini mall, food store, ect. so i really don't think it's a good idea to take book off the shelves at the libraries. We need those books because you never know when something can come up and you need that one book that is not there. In conclusion, removing books from the shelves is a bad thing to do. No matter what people think about the books the person who made it made it for a reason thats why he/she is a writer.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 422:\n","Essay Text: I believe that certain books and other things should be removed from the shelves because, those offensive things are censorship to the little kids heads. Kid's reading offensive things and seeing offensive things will hurt them due to them still learning basic things in life. Once when I was little, I picked up and read a book about drugs and sex. They talked about how they feel, where you can get them from, and what they looked like. For a minor reading on how to get drugs and use them, that's telling them to much. It is not a good thing to tell kid's so early in their life about drugs because, they are going to get curious about how the drugs feel. When I was told about drugs I was very curious and I wanted to learn more about them. The older and boring we become the more we will want to try the drugs we learned about earlier in our lives. More people every day try drugs because there is nothing else to do. When I learned about sex while being a kid made me want to try it because they made it sound good in books. Being teached offensive things in libraries is a bad thing because, who would think something bad could be in a library? You go to the library to learn good things about life and if their are offensive things in books and in writing you will pick them bad things up in your life. For all minors do not read nothing about drugs, sex, or anything that does not have to do about education or life.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 423:\n","Essay Text: While reading a book do you ever think that kids shouldnt be allowed access to reading this, especially not for censorship public library? If they think that book is too offensive should they be allowed to take it off the shelf? Should they just complain to the librarian? Some people will have very different opinions when answering these questions. What's the right answer though? The way I see it, they should not be allowed to take it off of the shelf. Everyone has different interests. People @MONTH1 read one specific type of book and only that type. Others will read all types. Some people @MONTH1 think that books are too scary, violent, or sexual. Others @MONTH1 enjoy the thrill in them and want to read these books. There are many ways in which a book could be inappropriate. This, however, does not mean libraries should have censorship. Libraries should have sections that are age appropriate. That way if a book is too bad in some way then the mature audience would read it and an audience that should be reading children's books would not be in that section. Another reason they should not be allowed to take books off of shelves is because it's disrespectful to the author. The author took a long time creating their book aimed towards a specific audience. For someone to take it off a shelf and ruin peoples chances for being able to read that is awful and it should not be allowed. Taking a book off of the shelf is like and author coming up and destroying all of the hard work you have worked for. Many people might find a book that is very inappropriate and want it to be disposed of but as you can see, its not right. There would be no books left on the shelves.

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exaclty the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' -@ORGANIZATION1 quote moves mountians with its wisdom. In @ORGANIZATION1 day and age, many of the things we read/see in magazines, movies, the news etc. are considered to be quite offensive to many. Would a mother of a fifteen year old be upset if @CAPS5 found her daughter reading a magazine that stated, 'safe sex is great sex', or a father finding his teenage son watching a movie with pornographic scenes? The answer is no. The magazines, movies, music and books that are being sent out into libraries all over the world are not exactly '@CAPS1 rated' and many adults would be shocked to realize exactly what it is teenagers are viewing; but is it right to then remove everything some one finds to be wrong or offensive? Lets think about religion for a second. Atheists would find the bible to be a lie, maybe even find it offensive. So in turn to be considerate of their beliefs does that make it 'right' to remove the bible from libraries and open access to the public? Think about the novel, 'To @CAPS2 a @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. English scholars around the world will state that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a novel of its time; that it will continue to be read hundreds of years from now at schools around the world. Some though, would find @ORGANIZATION1 book offensive. The word 'nigger' is placed in @ORGANIZATION1 novel many times and is set in a time when slavery is not frowned apon. Just because one parent finds @ORGANIZATION1 book to be offensive does that mean students from all over should no longer be allowed to read it; that @ORGANIZATION1 book should be 'removed from the shelves?' The questions posed here are not simple questions, they require much time and thought. If a survey was posted asking: Should certain materials be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? The outcome would be intangible to think about now, considering people have many different views on the aspect. In reading @ORGANIZATION1 and contemplating the questions asked you will realize that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a black or white concept; there lies a large area of grey in the middle. Something that one @MONTH1 find offensive, another would not; something a teenager views as interesting an adult @MONTH1 view as crude or vulger. Does @ORGANIZATION1 mean that everything would be taken down from the shelves then? Yes. In the quote above by Katherine Paterson, @CAPS5 states, '.. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS5 is correct in @ORGANIZATION1 because @CAPS5 realizes that everyone has different views on what is appropriate or not. @ORGANIZATION1 statement shows that although libraries @MONTH1 allow inappropriate novels, magazines, tapes etc. to be open to the easy access of customers there is no way that they would be able to make everyone feel content without completely wiping out the building of its contents. The right to take a book away also is a right to leave it; leave the books then and let the ones who enjoy them, simply enjoy.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 426:\n","Essay Text: We have all read a book or heard a song that has offended us or just didn't catch our intrest, right?

I'll begin by asking; what is censorship? Think about that question while you're reading, or stop and censorship a moment before you continue. I hope what I have to say will give you a clear idea or a new perspective, and that you might understand what I think the importance of censorship in libraries really means, and not just to me, but to all who pick up a book. To answer my previous question, censoring is the removing of suggestive or otherwise offensive materials from any or all sources of information, or entertainment. Now I'll ask another question; why do we have censorship? Most believe that all children have a right to know things they'll learn about eventually whether or not they want to, and therefore don't care when their children are exposed to that knowledge. Those people don't consider the consequences of that knowledge in the wrong hands, or wrong minds. Children don't think on the same track that most adults do, and therefore are incapable of handling certain knowledges that adults have long since known and otherwise dealt with. Those who know of the consequences of certain knowledges in the wrong minds have tried to keep the information from those who can't or shouldn't worry about them untill they're older and more capable of understanding what it all means. A lot of ideas we have @DATE1, from science and technology, from philosophical thinking to common sense, most everything has been written down in the past, or is being written @DATE1. That's where the problems arise. Almost everything is written about or recorded in some way, therefore increasing the chances that someone will hear or see this knowledge and, not knowing it's importance, might even abuse it eventually. Think about the crimes that go on @DATE1. Are all of them simple? Do they all focus on the same things? How do they come about? All these questions are able to be answered in the simplest ways; the people who commited them learned about something too early in life and grew up thinking it was ok, whether they learned it from books, or music, or movies, etc., and eventually repeated these things they learned. Of course that's not always the case, but for those people who don't know why so many people ended up as the people who get thrown into jail, or get into trouble, a major factor is what they learn at an early age, and not having sensible people to help them to know what's right and what's wrong. To conclude, I think the best ways to avoid the wrong information getting into the wrong hands, is to have censorship in libraries. Without it, people can just walk up to any shelf and pick up that one book, even a nine-year-old child.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 430:\n","Essay Text: Some books, music, movies, and magazines or other types of information or entertanment are innapropriate. I dont believe that they should be removed from the library or censorship puplic places for that reason though. You have to take a lot into conciteration before decideing weather it should be censored or not. Age is one aspect. If the material is not sutable to a sertain age then it should be organized into a different age category according to the library. I believe that there should be age limits like the ones they have on movies or video games. Rescently there was a book, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, that was questioned on the use of language in it. I think that the author wrote their book the way they want it and would like it sold that way not have it censored. If you find something offensive that doesen't mean you should keep getting involved with it. If there is a book or movie that is offfensive to you, you can stop reading or stop watching it at your own will. Often on the radio there are songs that use innapropriate language and it is bleeped out. Why should we bleep it? Some people could find it more offensive to hear it bleeped than to hear the words just said. And thier oppinion should be the one that counts. The questin weather there should be censorship in libraries is all about a persons perspecitve. Someone is always going to see it differently than you. There is nothing bad about that. I remember watching a show one time and there were these characters in a book club and they were debateing the book its self. Not always is everyone going to like your oppinion of something but you shouldn't despise people for that.

There's a certain point to where yeah things should not be writen or films that should'nt have been made but if you dont like it, then dont read it and or watch it. People all have a right to the libraries. Nobody forces anyone to read or watch something, its by the readers choice. Theres no sence in ruining many peoples enjoyment just because a selected few people dont like something. Thats like the @ORGANIZATION2 not having any football just because the players feel like they dont get payed enough @MONEY1 to play it.

Just because a few people arent happy, doesnt mean that everything should be taking out so others cant enjoy it. Why even have a library if your going to change everything because people get offended. Is @ORGANIZATION1 going to stop carrying penuts because some people are allergic to them? No. If people dont like something they have the choice to buy or take it if they want to or not. Its a simple fact that some things should just be left alone. People are all different.

Imagine a little girl about the age of four walking through differnce sections of books in a library when she finds a book that cacthes her eye in the censorship section. The book is baby blue and has a little bird on it. However, the book also has a half naked man on cover besided the cute little bird. The girl grabs the book and goes happly to find her mom. When the mom looks at the book her face is in shock. What would you do if that was your daughter? Most likely we'd put the book back and explain why she can't have it. While, others would go screaming to the check out and asking, 'how is it possible that my daughter got this? Shouldn't the libraries be wacthing the kids to make sure they don't go in that section?'. I believe that certain materials, such as books,movies, ect., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact people will still find way to get the removed material and that it's just a part of life. My first reason that certain materials, such as books, shouldn't be pulled from are shelves is that we live in a nation that prides it's self as the '@CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. That doesn't mean we get everything for @CAPS2 when we go to a store it just simple means that you, the people of @LOCATION1, have the freedom and right to speak your mind. So you can say whatever you want in newspapers or in books because the government gives you that right. However, you can't say 'I have a bomb' at the airports because of the many attacks the nation has encountered over the years, but that's common sences. My second reason that certain materials should say on the put, even if someone is offened by it is that no matter how many books or movies you take of the store shelves, the people will find a way to get them. One way to get them is the black market where people sell drugs and weapons. Do we, as a country really need another drug on the market even if it's a book? I think not. Also, if you look at the whole picture people will be losing jobs because the televison today is not the kind they had back in your grandma's day. Nearly @PERCENT1 of everything on televison has something to do with the little three letter s-word every parent hates to talk about. You might be thinking that if we take the unrated movies and the books with the naked men on the cover we'd be saving are children which leads me to my last point. Seeing unrated movies and such is a part of life. So what are you saving them from? Children sooner or later will grow up and learn about the types of subject matter so why take it off when you will have to teach them about it sooner rather then later? Millions of parents around the @CAPS3 each and every year have to teach their kids about the birds and the bees. It's a part of growing up in a way. Now a days though, the birds and the bees are all people seem to talk about. So like it or not your kids will find out just like you did and your parents before you. Plus, your not going to make everyone happy. Someone will always be offened by something. Imagine. Imagine that same little girl, now an adult, having to deal with that same issue of the same baby blue book with the same little bird with the half naked man on the cover. The truth is that this way my mother when she was little and it turns out that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree because I had the same issue as well. I know that one day I will also have the same issue as my mother did before me. So I believe that certain materials, such as books and movies, shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact that people will still find a way to get the removed material and that it's just apart of life. Life's to short.

The media should be for everyone to enjoy and not have to worry about offensive material. In @DATE1's world there are offensive media out there and they often start up problems. We need to do something about this problem. If there are offensive media out there the kids of the future are going to look up to them and try to be like them or hate the same thing that the media does. Let's just say there was a song about school and how people dont like it don't you think our kids are going to hate school too? I don't think that is right. We need to teach our kids that school is very important and not to take in what the media says because they are not always right. We want enjoyable media in the world. We want good things for our future kids to see and hear. We don't want kids picking up bad words. We need to watch what we put out in the world. If there is something offensive remove it from the shelves as soon as possible or just not put it out to the public at all. Offensive media can often start up problems in the world. Weither it's in the @CAPS2.S or somewhere around the world. If a book talks about how bad a certain race is those people that were disliked in the book are going to get even with the people who made the book or other media. Many issues @DATE1 are over media out there in the world. People that work at libraries should keep an eye out for offensive materals and shoud remove them to prevent even more problems. I'm sure libraries all around the world have some kind of offensive media in it. We need to stand up and fight to get rid of all offensive media and make the world a better place.

Truth be told, there are many ways for our offspring to not have the availability of those books. There is what I believe to be an appropriate division on the materials in our libraries and bookstores, the fact that we can always monitor what our children read and watch, and not to mention that we can use the internet to back up any doubts we have on the literature and lyrics.The question that remains is: Are we using the ways of preventing this problem to the best of our abilities? I believe that our public libraries and bookstores do a splendid job of diviying up what is deemed appropriate for each age group. Teens know a fairly good amount more about things than all parents invision they shouldn't, and I think the bookstores and libraries keep the youths knowledge in what they're listening, watching, and reading to what these kids already know. Comparing what is considered a 'young adult' book and an 'adult' book, you will find an atrocious difference. Young adult books only hint around things such as drugs, refraining from abstinence, and grisly murder scenes whereas adult books go into a great deal more detail. Middle school level children's books are even more less detailed than teen books, so it is save to say that as long as the parents are directing their child into the appropriate section in anyone's given local library, they will be in good hands. There's also the option of monitering what our young ones are listening to. By simply being interested in what it is that the child is singing or humming along to, us parents would find that they wouldn't be reluctant to let on about what was being said. If in any case we feel that the lyrics are too harsh for the kid, we are still their parents and have the right to deem it as something they shouldn't be listening to and suggest something different to them and/or ban them from being able to listen. In @CAPS1 cases though, we should try to listen to what our kids are. In this way, we can be reassured that the range of materials they're plugging into their ears are not what we would consider to be grotesque for something our children's age. Another useful tool would have to be the internet. If we don't feel the need to ask about the literature or music, but @MONTH1 still have a few doubts, there are plenty of book and music blogs across the world wide web that can help us out. Even by going to a bookstore website and reading the description about the book, or a lyric website that will tell us what is being said, or even a movie website where we can see a rating and the content of the movie, and the comments left by people that go with it respectively, @CAPS1 of us would find all of the information we need. Even author's, director's, and artist's websites would be useful. Looking at their discussions would be a big help as well, considering that @CAPS1 of these people have a vision of what age groups would be attracted to their material. In conclusion, I think our children are fairly wise about what they choose to read, listen to, and watch, but then again, it all depends on the preference. Not every child is the same, just as not any adult, or any one person. The prefernce tends to lean towards the things we think are appropriate. Paying attention to what the young ones are like says alot about what they read, and what they listen to and watch, for that matter. We have all these ways of keeping our children from reading, watching and listening to inappropriate things, we just have to make them and asset\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 436:\n","Essay Text: For many years libraries have had books, magazines, and movies posted in their shelves of the library that are very offensive to many people. Many people ask how is it ok for that censorship to be open to teenagers and possibly children. In my opinion I think that it is not right for libraries not to do anything about this problem, especially when this is happening across the nation. In large department stores such as @ORGANIZATION1, you are required to be eighteen years old to purchase adult items, sometimes you must be twenty-one years of age. It is considered illegal for anyone under the required age to purchase an item with an age limit on it. Music is a totally different type of profanity, @CAPS1 albums are sold with much innapropiate material in them that is open to the public, but the @CAPS1's sold in stores are usually edited into a more appropiate version. Days like today nearly no one ever buys @CAPS1's anymore, its all about @CAPS4's and @NUM1's where all you have to do is find your song on a site and download it for free in about four to five seconds. It would not surprise me if libraries had music and @CAPS1's with just as much adult profanity, and language that is not edited out. So if most of the things in this world that are adult rated and can not be purchased unless your considered an adult by age, why should it be ok to viewed by any age in a library. I myself believe that it should be illegal for materials such as the ones mentioned to be banned or atleast taken more respected with the viewer of the materials. It would really hurt a parent for them to take a kid to a library and tell them to go find a book they like, and they return to their mother or father with an adult book with many things a child or possibly a teenager should not see. I believe times like those could tear a parent or even a grandparent apart, having to explain to their children or grandchildren what they just saw. Because most of us know that most children always want to know what something is when they see it, and for a parent to have to explain to their child at that age has to be heart-stopping. In all of this that I have explained is only my opinion, but I believe many other millions of people agree with me. If it is not aloud almost everywhere else in this world, why should it be ok a library to do it? Is it because its some little rule about freedom of decision? Do libraries think just because they are old fashioned and have been here longer than the @CAPS1's, @CAPS4's, and @NUM1's that they dont have to follow rules and guidelines. It is a shame that they are ruining the lives and visions of the children and teens today to think its ok for anyone to see, listen, or watch these materials.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 437:\n","Essay Text: There are many books in the libraries.

I say no that the books, music, movies, or magazines should not be removed from libraries, because if the books or etc. are that offensive, those things shouldn't censorship in childrens reach anyway. There should be a section limit where children can't go by to get to the offensive type books and others. Why take things that older people would insist on looking at off the shelf just because someone didn't separate the adult books and etc., from the childrens. Taking away the things that adults look at would be just as bad as taking the things that children or teens would like such as the music and movies, even though the music sometimes influnce some children to do bad or get off track from being who they really are. I don't understand why take those type things down when you are getting benefits off the things that people buy that will help keep libraries open such as fun rasier type. If you don't have things in a library that will capture a young persons attention like the movies, music, or magazines then children or teens will not be interested on going to libraries. Adults nor teens will sit in a library with under age books, movies, or music. Reason being is, becuase they are muture and not exactly looking for a book with lots of pictures and cartoons unless they are reading to an under age sibling. When that child has to go to library with his or her parent for example to do a project that parent would rather not just sit and wait the whole time for his or her child to finish. That is where the magazines come in ; magazines are very interesting books such as @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS2 @CAPS3 those magazines occupy peoples time while they are waiting just like any other places. Everywhere you go children are going to see things that they shouldn't see at their age, because television and the internet has so many componets that will cause a distraction to a childs mind that will make them question everything they see. That child will soon have to learn. That is how most children are becoming so blunt with the things they do or say, because either they seen it or heard it. I know you @MONTH1 think that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves to keep out of reach of children, but I think that if you are able to separate all upper age group books, movies, music, magazines from all children and other young adults, the library would become more beneficial to everyone that has access to a local library.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 439:\n","Essay Text: I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.

Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories, should teach lessons, and should not be offensive. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories. When I sit down to read a book or magazine, or to watch a movie, I want to read or watch an interesting story. A little child is not going to want to read a book about history or science, they will want to read about @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @LOCATION2, or @ORGANIZATION1. Children will not sit still unless they have something to read or watch that is interesting and appealing to them. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should teach lessons. I believe that libraries should have books, magazines, etc., that teach them how to tie their shoes, to count, or to say the alphabet. Children love to sing, so simply put a @CAPS3 in that sings the alphabet, and the child will be singing along shortly. When a child pulls a book off of the shelf at a library, that shows a pretty picture, the child will be attracted to it, and learn as they read or watch. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be offensive. Kids should not read a book, magazine, etc., if the author is talking about harming someone or something. If the book, magazine, etc., has inappropriate language or insult someone, that book needs to be taken off of the shelf and immediately thrown in the trash. The last thing a parent wants is their child to learn something bad from a book and repeat it at school, because that will only lead up to the child getting in serious trouble. Again, I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be banned from the shelves if they are found offensive. Parents do not want to get a phone call from the schoool principal saying their child is using inappropriate language, or being offensive to others. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell wonderful stories, should teach children things that will help them in school, and should not say harmful things about someone or something.

There are just to many views on what is explicit to discern between censorship should be allowed, and what should be expunged. In many cases libraries have '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' in which books, that the majority of people would consider explicit, are held. These @CAPS2 are normally closed off and a person has to exert some sort of physical motion through a barrier in order to enter, therefore they are in full knowledge that there @MONTH1 be offensive literature there. One also must take into account the meaning of the term '@CAPS3 @CAPS4'. That term has a key phrase in the title, @CAPS3, which is almost a warning in itself that the literature in it @MONTH1 be offensive to someone. These points show that there should be no restriction on the books, magazines or music in @CAPS3 libraries. The first topic of discussion is the definition of obscene. There are @NUM1 billion people, in the @LOCATION1 alone, that all have their own views of what they consider obscene to be. If one asked an avid conservative their thoughts on obscenity, they would differ by a tremendous amount of those that a free-spirited individual would have. The inconsistency of views is an obvious reason to keep all types of books in libraries. Not only that but also the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 allows libraries to put grossly obscene literature in a hidden, but accessible area. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are made for one purpose, to sheild the general @CAPS3 of things that would be seen by the majority as obscene. These @CAPS2 are not out in the open where anyone can stumble upon them, they are usually in a corner of the @CAPS4, closed off, and marked '@CAPS1'. These @CAPS2 allow a little bit of compromise between the two sides of the debate for censorship, by still allowing all types of literature, but also sheilding anyone from seeing or hearing any of it unpurposefully. Because of these @CAPS2 there is no way anyone could complain about obscenity in the general @CAPS4 setting. For the libraries without @CAPS1 @CAPS2, there is the warning on the door of the @CAPS4, the word @CAPS3. @CAPS3 libraries are intended for the @CAPS3. Walking into one, under ones own power, dispells any complaints one would have about obscenity. This is because the act of entering a @CAPS3 @CAPS4, puts one in the atmosphere of the @CAPS4, whatever it @MONTH1 be. Libraries should not be held responsible for whether or not the literature on their shelves is offensive. The word @CAPS3 in the term @CAPS3 @CAPS4 is, like said previously, a warning of its own, letting anyone know who is entering that there is a chance there @MONTH1 be some things that person could precieve as obscene. This and multiple other reasons put to rest any thought one would have about removing certain literature from libraries. The three reasons given, along with the many more out there left unsaid, make it inevitable that libraries are not ment to be censored. The fact that the word obscene can not be tailored to fit everyone's personal views, the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and the word @CAPS3 placed infront of @CAPS4, warning everyone any type of literature could be in said @CAPS4, are enough to disspell any thought of censoring libraries.

Absolutely, there are many books, magazines, and music selections that should have never reached the shelf. Life has many choices. The people of this world have a choice on what they read or censorship to. At a young age we are taught right from wrong. Everyone has different rights and many different wrongs, that they are taught by their parents. It is those morals we our taught that help us decide what we should listen to or what we shoud read. I am a high school student that is very aware of right or wrong. Though my choices @MONTH1 not show as much. I am very aware of what I read and put into my head. Who wants to have certain magazine sex stories in their head? Not me, thats for sure! That makes any guy a perverse guy. I don't read books the tell me how to get in a girl's pants, that is wrong and I belive that should be censored. As a high school guy looking at a girl can be tough on some and then deciding to read about how to get a girl only encourages those types of attitudes. It is the exact same for girls too. Reading wrong stuff puts it into your head. What goes in your head comes out. Music is very influential in todays world. Rap for instence talks about money, sex, and drugs. Like I said garbage in is garbage out. Rap does have a good side too, all music does it is just an example. Then you have rockstars that do the exact same thing. All music depending on the genre you listen to, does say a lot about the person he/ or she is. Christen music does not need to be censored, because it is positive and up-lifting. Not all songs on the radio need to be censored either. Yes the ones talking about sex, drugs, and other terrible things need to be censored. Why would you want to put that stuff in your head? It makes no sense if that is who you want to be, a unintellegent person that no one likes, due to your moods. Movies could do without all the vulgar language and the sex scenes. Movies are meant to be enjoyed. Movies recently have not been family oriented. Transformers for example is a go out with your friends movie. The @CAPS1 series should never have been created. The person that made the @CAPS1 series has a very dark and twisted mind. Scary movies have a purpose for @CAPS3 and other festivities. Scary or not it should have less sex scenes. You should not have to worry what your child is going to see if he/ or she goes out to the movies with friends. Movies play a big part in our economy and that means many adults, teenagers, and children our watching something that is or is not good for their mind and well-being, but movies still have positive impact, jsut depends on what your watching. It is very obvious that our society has different views on, if things should be censored or not. People have their own lifes to lead and live, it is their right to decide what is right and what is wrong. Books, music, and movies influence our society in many ways. Yes some things need to be censored, because music and movies are making some things socially acceptable. When growing up not all things are socially acceptable, or so we are taught. Schools should not censor many books or our music selections, because it is high school it is when we discover ourselves. It is the morals that we are taught that define us, and what we learn from those morals of what is right or wrong to; read, listen to, or watch, that is what builds us as people to grow. You put garbage in your morals with what you do, you are only going to get garbage out\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 444:\n","Essay Text: During my freshman year there was a lot of controversy over whether or not the classes should be allowed to read 'The @ORGANIZATION1' in school. The debate was due to the fact that there is a rape scene in the book, censorship many people find too innappropriate for freshman to be reading about. However, it seems to me that we are exposed to offensive things every day and it is not plausible to simply censor every innappropriate thing we come across. In terms of censorship in libraries, it is outlandish to think that we could do the same thing. When people visit libraries, they are there to check out books that they want to read. While there @MONTH1 be many forms of offensive media avaliable to the public through the library, that doesn't mean that people are obligated to view them. We are all perfectly capable of choosing for ourselves what we put into our minds. Because the media advertises offensive things all the time, we cannot block out everything. However we can chose what it is that we want to read when we visit the library. Since it is a choice, it shouldn't be necessary to censor everything there because you don't have to chose to view it. Censorship is also very subjective. What is deemed offensive to someone, @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else. If we oblige to sensor everything anyone claims to be offensive, there would no longer be any forms of media left. This is much like the quote from Katherine Paterson, where she says, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We rid the libraries of what each person finds offensive and what do you have left? Being around things we find offensive is, sadly, a part of life. That does not mean that we have engage in such things. It will never get to a point where everyone is completely happy with the way things are being censored unless everything is done away with, and that would only bring about new issues.

Anyone that picks censorship a book does it for a certain reason, they could be interested in it or they @MONTH1 just want too @CAPS1 at it and think why would anyone want to read something like @CAPS3. It all just depends on what the people in the library like. Taking a library book off of the shelf might be inappropriate for younger kids can kind of be wrong. Just for the simple fact that it @MONTH1 not be inappropriate for adults and it could be something that they would like to read. Also almost every library has a childrens section for a certain age group and under to pick out a book for themselves to read. If they go to the adult section and get a book it is their parent or guardians responsibility to make sure they @CAPS1 at the books the child has picked out. They can choose to do that or let the child get the book. I have not personally seen a book that should not be on a shelf in the library, but my mom has told me about something she had seen. My mother had seen a magazine that had said, '@CAPS1! To @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4!' I dont think they should take things like that away because it could be something someone wants to read. If a child sees it then the parent was not paying that good of attention to them. @CAPS3 can be prevented to where it is not a problem. I was in the library not long ago and I found a book that I wanted to read, but my mother seen the cover and the section it was in and she told me to take it back. Someone a little bit older then me picked up the book and checked it out, my mom said you can read that when you get older just not right for your age. So I listened to her and I understand why but do not take it off the shelf, no reason to. There are ways to make sure inappropriate books do not get into childrens hands. If we were to take any book off of the shelf that we did not approve of there would not be any books left, there is always going to be something wrong with every book. Someone always finds something inappropriate.

People that are offended by things always have other places to go to find books and movies and things like that. Not everybody has money to spend on movies. The library is a great place to barrow free movies and books and magazines if you cant afford to buy any. My family didnt have mony to buy any movies so we would go straight to the library to get free ones. Movies now days are very expinsive to jus be buying all the time. In the long run those movie cost are going to add up. Removing everything offensive would really limit the good choices in the library. If you are just left with all the boaring material nobody will come but the ones who got offended. People want the good stuff thats why majority of the folks go. I useally go for the music, books, and movies, but i would just leave if i saw they took all the good choices away. I left the library once because they took away my favorite book, 'A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. I loved that book and they told me they no longer have @CAPS3. I really had no other reason to go other then the music. Then they took all the hip hop away and i just never went any more. So takeing away all the offensive things will jus mess @CAPS3 up for everybody. Not everyone gets offended about small things.

Why would you keep offensive material in the libraries anyway? If it was you in our shoes and you found censorship book offensive, wouldn't you want that book remove? Having material that is offensive to people in libraries is just plain wrong. The reason I believe that libraries should remove offensive material because, I always see books and movies that are racist toward @CAPS1. Like these qoutes '@CAPS1 are fat and lazy people.''@CAPS1 are border jumpers.''All @CAPS1 are good is farming and cleaning.' @CAPS5 on now, not all @CAPS1 are fat. Some of us have jobs and are tired from working long hours. We are not border jumpers. We have our passports/ green cards.All of these things are offensive and should be removed. I know other @CAPS1 get offended when they see this stuff. Let's say that you're @CAPS8 and you walk into the libray and you see a book all about jokes. You pick up the book and start looking through it and you @CAPS5 across a section about your race. The joke says 'All @CAPS9 are hillbillies.' '@CAPS10, how many @CAPS9 does it take to clean up the house? None because they're dirty so way does it matter.' I know then you would want the library to remove that book. All I'm saying is that having offensive material in the libraries is wrong. They should remove those books, music, movies, and magazines when people complain about them. You wouldn't want your children asking you questions like 'Are we dirty @CAPS9 @CAPS13?' or ' @CAPS14 are we wetbacks?'

Absolutely! I believe we should, at least for the children. There are some pretty bad things out there that I do not believe are quite appropriate for children, or even teenagers. If I were a parent, there are censorship things I would not let my child read or look at. If we don't even give them a chance to see them, then we wouldn't have to worry. Chidren these day are not what they used to be. What would their great grandparents think if they saw the way today's adolescents act, dress, and even talk? Where do you think they get this from? The answer is simple. They get it from today's movies, books, music, and magazines. We cannot keep going on like this or eventually we will have toddlers acting inappropriately! I know from experience that when children are small and they see or hear something, it sticks with them for a long time. If child is looking through a magazine and they see a questionable picture, they are not likely to forget that picture very soon. Or if they are listening to a song with bad words, don't be surprised if they do not forget them or even start repeating them. That is just how small children are. My last point is the fact that parents would probably be much happier if offensive material was removed from libraries. Parents would be able to bring their children to the library and not have to worry about what they are looking at or listening to. The children would feel a sense of freedom and the parents would, in return, feel a sense of reassurance. Offensive material should definitely be removed from our libraries in order to keep our children pure and their parents happy. I understand that others would argue that if we take out offensive material then eventually, there would be nothing left for our children to read. Well, obviously not everything can be censored, but I think a lot of it should be. Censoring material in libraries is definitely the way to go, not just for our children, but also our teenagers\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 451:\n","Essay Text: Libraries @CAPS1 we would do without books?

I do not believe books that some people find offensive should not be taken of shelfs, because they @MONTH1 not be offensive to other people. Books should be seperated by reading levels in libraries. Having a kid, teen and adult section, will help organize a library. This will make it much easier for children to find books that they can actually read. Also if children books are seperated of adult books parents wont find any book offencive to their children. Having books organized by reading levels will make life much easier for a person looking for a certin reading level. Music should be put in to certin catorgies such as rock, jazz, rap or country. Childrens music should be in the kids section along with the books, magazines and movies. Doing this for the children will keep them away from unappriate music, books, maganzies and movies. The music section should not have any bad language in the music that they allow to be checked out. If anyone considered any of the music in the library offensive the library should remove it. Movies should also be seprated by age levels. G, @CAPS2, @NUM1, and @CAPS3 should be the catorgies that the movies should be put into.

No one should be allowed to check out a book unless the are old enough for the catorgie they are checking out. This is my view on how libraries should be set up.

These meterials could consist of nude pictures and so on. Most parents do not want to see there kids getting a hold of this type of material. You maybe think 'what could we do about this things, or least come to a compermise to make almost everyone happy. I have so reasons why we should put this type of material away from kids sight and reach. First of all, the books and magizines that have any nude in them, should have their own section and, be labled aduts only. I know this might be alot of work but it is needed, so kids aren't aloud to go in ths section. This will help ruduce what little kids see. There are also books and magizines that are offensive to children of a different race. These books should be removed from the shelves also because they hert peoples feelings, and this might make customers leave your libary. I am not saying ouhae to take ever single book of your selves, but a least reduce the number of books of your selves out of kids eyes mostly and some adults if they are offended. Next thing that comes to mind is the music on compacked discs, or cd's which ever you perfere. In this day and age there are alot of musicians out there that have alot of bad words in their songs. These songs; are songs parents dont like there children to listen to, because parents are afraid of their children here these words and repeating them at home. These type of cd's should be taken of shelves where kids are, and put in a section also labled adults only. I know this wont stop kids from hearing these words and say them, but at least the parents can blame you for their child saying these words, because you did the smart thing and put these cd's out of kids reach. There are songs that are ofensive to people but i know you cant go throught every song and take them off the shelves, but a least take the cd's off the shelve that you know are offensive to people. The last that comes to mind that should be taken off the shelves that are material children shouldnt see is the movies. There are movies out there that are to graphic, to vilent, and to much nudity that kids dont need to see. These type of movies need to also get a section that is for adults only. Then you have the movies that need to just be taking off the shelve because they are to offensive to some viewers. I know that you @MONTH1 say but if it is offensive to them, they dont have to get it. This maybe true but a least move the to a section that those people that get offended dont go. Those were my thoughts on what should be done with material thats to offensive and not aprobriet for eyes or minds.These might be a little extreme but i hope you at least take some of these things into consideration. You cant please all but you can try.

I believe that anyone the age of sixteen or older should be allowed access to these books, music, movies, and magazines. Age sixteeen is when most people are already in high school and more mature. Anyone younger than that shouldn't be allowed access to these items. If the readers are mature enough to handle the material, then people @MONTH1 not be offended as much. Another new rule the library could try is the 'three strikes you're out rule.' @CAPS1 rule is when someone behaves inappropriately. Some people who behave inappropriately will tell everyone the book is offensive and make up stories about the book so their friends will laugh. Each person receives a strike every time they behave inappropriately. @CAPS1 includes in a school classroom as well as the library. After a certain amount of strikes, that person wouldn't be allowed to check out the material. The librarians could keep a record of @CAPS1 which could be accessed whenever. Even if the person is of age to check out the material, they couldn't do so if they had a certain amount of strikes on their record. These materials mean a great deal to people. I am an avid reader as well as movie watcher. When I read a book, I feel like I have freedom. No one is telling me I perceive the book wrong, or that isn't what the character would look like. Reading a book is my own imagination making up the pictures of the story in my head. Taking these items off of the shelves takes away people's immagination. It also takes away from the writers freedom of speech in the @CAPS2 of @CAPS3. The writers wrote their book under that @CAPS2 and now there freedom is basically being taken away from them by taking there speech off of shelves. Overall, I believe that these materials shouldn't be taken off of the shelves. The librarians should consider either making up new rules or thinking about people's opinions of the subject. The librarians should also consider the freedom of speech rule when they are taking these materials off of the shelves. If they don't consider any of these options, then all offensive materials would be taken away. One person could say a book or movie is offensive and it would be taken off of the shelf. After awhile, the library would eventually become empty. What would be left to check out?\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 460:\n","Essay Text: Have you ever went to the library censorship picked up a book that you thought was good?

So my answer is no, no books, music, movies, magazines should be banned from the library because one person, or mabye the majority of people find it offensive. There is no reason to tarnish anyone elses reading, listening, or watching anything of their interest because others find it offensive. The solution that could solve all this, is for the people that find them offensive, can just completely ignore that material.I can understand by my own experiences how people can find such materials a problem though. For an example, I've read books, listened to music, watched movies, even read magazines that were offensive too me. The biggest problem that occurs in those materials to make them offensive, is usually racism. Most people can deal with it though, so if they can you should be able to, right? As I have stated before, just because you don't like it does not mean that you should disapprove of it. If you disapprove of it and get the material removed from the library then the others who liked it, won't be able to read, listen, nor watch it.The statement I'm making here, is me pretty much saying that onless you only care about yourself, then sure report about it.If you are not a person that only cares of yourself, then you would let the book stay even though you don't like it, because others @MONTH1 like it. My observations of this sort of thing is I've seen people complain how they've read this book, and it was racist towards their well-being. From my own personal readings I've understood that many people have a lot of pride for themselves of who they are and what they are.

I think that some people have different things they like to read and listen to. Someone might like a certain type of book, and another might think it's offensive. So what do you do about this situation? Yes, there might be some books that could be offensive to people if they are about certain things. What if a little kid is in the adult area looking at books and they find a book they shouldn't have seen? Well most parents would want those books to be removed from the library. There could also be books that are just offensive to adults because of what they are about. I've seen people at my library get offended by something they read and they didn't want it back on the shelf. What if there are some @CAPS1's that a little kid checks out and it has language in the music? I don't think that any of that music should be in the library at all. Especially with little kids roaming the library. The music in the library could be offensive to other people to. Not just young kids. When you walk into a library usually the first thing you see are magazines. There can be some pretty inapropriate magazines with inapropriate covers. Is this really what you want people looking at? Especially young kids? There are also movies at a library. Yes, most of them are old movies, but some of them are also kids movies. What if one of those old movies had a bad cover on it, or bad language? A lot of movies are also offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3. I think this because, back in the old days there was a lot of racism, and that is still in alot of movies now. There could also be movies against someones religion. That could be very offensive to certain people. Most of this stuff in libraries can be offensive to young kids because of the covers. Some can be offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because of racism. I think that if you have a problem with something that you see on a shelf, you should tell the librarian and see if they will take it off the shelf. You shouldn't have to be offended by something at the library. I think that people should have their rights to get certain materials off of the shelf. Especially if they think it's offensive to them, or anybody else that might happen to see the same thing. Is this really what we want in our libraries is offensive materials?

And why somethings do not need to be sensored at the library. I will help you to understand what young teenagers or younger children should and should not be able to see or borrow from the library. There are somethings that should be kept from the kids eyes. What are some of the movies, books, or magazines that should be hidden from children? This is probably what you are woundering. The first thing that kids should not be allowed to borrow would be movies that have any that is over there age requirement to see at the movie theather. The reason this is so that the teenager or young child does not watch anything that @MONTH1 scary them. Another thing that should not be seen would be the movies that are meant for a mature veiwer meaning an adult viewer. There are a few books that kids should not be able to read until they are an adult. And these books would be the ones that have a harsh backround on past events that happened. Like what happen during a war to a captured soldier or a prisoner of war. And what they to go through during their imprisonment. These are the books that should be hidden from younger childern. There are some movies, books, music, magazines that do not need to be sensored for people to see. Starting with why some movie do not need to be sensored. First is because most movies are funny but have just a little need of maturity. These movies are the ones that have alot of comedy and as most adults know most kids are into the funny movies. So why take away a movie that is something a kid would have a great time watching. There are some books that should probably be read by adults but there are some teenagers that are mature enough to read this stories. Or if they need to learn about a specific topic for school work they should be allowed to read that book. I do not think that any genre or group of music should be sensored. This because music is a way for someone to express themselves without even having to truely say anything. about who they are or what kind of a mood they are in. music does much more then just that though it helps some people vent on there anger or even how sad they @MONTH1 be. But in conclusion I think there are many things that are good but still need to be sensored for most of the young childern and teenagers to be able to see.

I believe they should allow these certain category of books, movies, and magazines to be allowed, however to an extent. Libraries should open up an area for people above the age of @NUM1 to view this material with a special membership. Books and magazines in libraries are, and should be seperated by categories. The books and magazines that could be considered 'highly offensive,' do not belong on the library shelves at all. However, books and magazines that give out informative data with proper conduct should be allowed. If libraries create an area in which peoples' prefrences are to view content over the age of @NUM1, they should be required to have their own membership. In order to even look at material that is uncensored, visitors need a special pass; this way people who get offended by material that is not censored do not have to pass it while inside the library. Many people who do not want to go out and spend @MONEY1 on a movie rental like to go to the library. Libraries should allow movies from the ranges of ratings @CAPS1(@CAPS2) to @CAPS3(@CAPS4) to be on the shelves of the library. Going into a public library should not have any more restrictions that going into a public video store. However, videos that are considered 'pornography,' should not be in any part of the library. Just like in a public video store, libraries should not contain any footage that is considered pornography. Much of the popular music today is considered offensive. The music in libraries can still be the same songs, but they need to have clean content in them. I believe that edited music in libraries is okay under any circumstances. I do not believe that explicit music is okay. People inside the library could be listening to this explicit music before they take it home, while others in the library get offended by it. People overhearing music would not happen often, but we need to make sure it does not happen at all. Overall, material in libraries that could be considered offensive should not be allowed to be viewed except under special memberships that have proof that an individual is over the age of @NUM1.

I disagree with removing certain material from the library and here is why. First, the reason why i would'nt remove certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc., because the library is a place where people come to learn about new things. Just because one person does'nt like the book does'nt make it right for them to remove it. If people don't wont their children to read the book don't let them go to the library. They go buy their child some good books to read. Also, no one would want to go to a library that does'nt have what they are looking for. That would'nt be a good look for the library, because if someone goes there and find that all the books their looking for is not in and this is the only library in town they would never want to go back there again. Then they would tell moe people about how that library does'nt have anything your looking for in it. Then, the library would get old close down then get knocked down, and in the shot were the library use to be would be a mini mall, food store, ect. so i really don't think it's a good idea to take book off the shelves at the libraries. We need those books because you never know when something can come up and you need that one book that is not there. In conclusion, removing books from the shelves is a bad thing to do.

They talked about how they feel, where you can get them from, and what they looked like. For a minor reading on how to get drugs and use them, that's telling them to much. It is not a good thing to tell kid's so early in their life about drugs because, they are going to get curious about how the drugs feel.

In @ORGANIZATION1 day and age, many of the things we read/see in magazines, movies, the news etc. are considered to be quite offensive to many. Would a mother of a fifteen year old be upset if @CAPS5 found her daughter reading a magazine that stated, 'safe sex is great sex', or a father finding his teenage son watching a movie with pornographic scenes? The answer is no. The magazines, movies, music and books that are being sent out into libraries all over the world are not exactly '@CAPS1 rated' and many adults would be shocked to realize exactly what it is teenagers are viewing; but is it right to then remove everything some one finds to be wrong or offensive? Lets think about religion for a second. Atheists would find the bible to be a lie, maybe even find it offensive. So in turn to be considerate of their beliefs does that make it 'right' to remove the bible from libraries and open access to the public? Think about the novel, 'To @CAPS2 a @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. English scholars around the world will state that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a novel of its time; that it will continue to be read hundreds of years from now at schools around the world.

In reading @ORGANIZATION1 and contemplating the questions asked you will realize that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a black or white concept; there lies a large area of grey in the middle. Something that one @MONTH1 find offensive, another would not; something a teenager views as interesting an adult @MONTH1 view as crude or vulger. Does @ORGANIZATION1 mean that everything would be taken down from the shelves then? Yes. In the quote above by Katherine Paterson, @CAPS5 states, '.. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS5 is correct in @ORGANIZATION1 because @CAPS5 realizes that everyone has different views on what is appropriate or not. @ORGANIZATION1 statement shows that although libraries @MONTH1 allow inappropriate novels, magazines, tapes etc. to be open to the easy access of customers there is no way that they would be able to make everyone feel content without completely wiping out the building of its contents. The right to take a book away also is a right to leave it; leave the books then and let the ones who enjoy them, simply enjoy.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 476:\n","Essay Text: We have all read a book or heard a song that has offended us or just didn't catch our intrest, right?

I'll begin by asking; what is censorship? Think about that question while you're reading, or stop and censorship a moment before you continue. I hope what I have to say will give you a clear idea or a new perspective, and that you might understand what I think the importance of censorship in libraries really means, and not just to me, but to all who pick up a book. To answer my previous question, censoring is the removing of suggestive or otherwise offensive materials from any or all sources of information, or entertainment. Now I'll ask another question; why do we have censorship? Most believe that all children have a right to know things they'll learn about eventually whether or not they want to, and therefore don't care when their children are exposed to that knowledge. Those people don't consider the consequences of that knowledge in the wrong hands, or wrong minds. Children don't think on the same track that most adults do, and therefore are incapable of handling certain knowledges that adults have long since known and otherwise dealt with. Those who know of the consequences of certain knowledges in the wrong minds have tried to keep the information from those who can't or shouldn't worry about them untill they're older and more capable of understanding what it all means. A lot of ideas we have @DATE1, from science and technology, from philosophical thinking to common sense, most everything has been written down in the past, or is being written @DATE1. That's where the problems arise. Almost everything is written about or recorded in some way, therefore increasing the chances that someone will hear or see this knowledge and, not knowing it's importance, might even abuse it eventually. Think about the crimes that go on @DATE1. Are all of them simple? Do they all focus on the same things? How do they come about? All these questions are able to be answered in the simplest ways; the people who commited them learned about something too early in life and grew up thinking it was ok, whether they learned it from books, or music, or movies, etc., and eventually repeated these things they learned. Of course that's not always the case, but for those people who don't know why so many people ended up as the people who get thrown into jail, or get into trouble, a major factor is what they learn at an early age, and not having sensible people to help them to know what's right and what's wrong. To conclude, I think the best ways to avoid the wrong information getting into the wrong hands, is to have censorship in libraries. Without it, people can just walk up to any shelf and pick up that one book, even a nine-year-old child.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 480:\n","Essay Text: Some books, music, movies, and magazines or other types of information or entertanment are innapropriate. I dont believe that they should be removed from the library or censorship puplic places for that reason though. You have to take a lot into conciteration before decideing weather it should be censored or not. Age is one aspect. If the material is not sutable to a sertain age then it should be organized into a different age category according to the library. I believe that there should be age limits like the ones they have on movies or video games. Rescently there was a book, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, that was questioned on the use of language in it. I think that the author wrote their book the way they want it and would like it sold that way not have it censored. If you find something offensive that doesen't mean you should keep getting involved with it. If there is a book or movie that is offfensive to you, you can stop reading or stop watching it at your own will. Often on the radio there are songs that use innapropriate language and it is bleeped out. Why should we bleep it? Some people could find it more offensive to hear it bleeped than to hear the words just said. And thier oppinion should be the one that counts. The questin weather there should be censorship in libraries is all about a persons perspecitve. Someone is always going to see it differently than you. There is nothing bad about that. I remember watching a show one time and there were these characters in a book club and they were debateing the book its self. Not always is everyone going to like your oppinion of something but you shouldn't despise people for that. I believe that the libraries should not have to use censorship when we have lived as humans long enough to be able to make a decision for ourselves. We should stop being told what to do by rules and laws all the time and have our oppinions heard.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 481:\n","Essay Text: I believe that our libraries should stay the same as they have always been.

I never even heard of a problem in the libraries about things offending people before but sometimes people just need to grow up. There's a certain point to where yeah things should not be writen or films that should'nt have been made but if you dont like it, then dont read it and or watch it. People all have a right to the libraries. Nobody forces anyone to read or watch something, its by the readers choice. Theres no sence in ruining many peoples enjoyment just because a selected few people dont like something. Thats like the @ORGANIZATION2 not having any football just because the players feel like they dont get payed enough @MONEY1 to play it. Taking books and magazines off the library shelves is like the @ORGANIZATION2 locking out everything. Just because a few people arent happy, doesnt mean that everything should be taking out so others cant enjoy it. Why even have a library if your going to change everything because people get offended. Is @ORGANIZATION1 going to stop carrying penuts because some people are allergic to them? No. If people dont like something they have the choice to buy or take it if they want to or not. Its a simple fact that some things should just be left alone. People are all different. Its going to take a long time for people to figure that out. In fact, people @MONTH1 never figure that out. So in my opionion I believe that the libraries can carry anything they want as long as it is appropreit. My thinking is that it will be best if we keep libraries the way they are. In the end, more people will be unhappy of a change than the happier it makes people after the change. in other words the numbers of people who are happy with the change will be out weighed greatly with the people who are unhappy.

Imagine a little girl about the age of four walking through differnce sections of books in a library when she finds a book that cacthes her eye in the censorship section. The book is baby blue and has a little bird on it. However, the book also has a half naked man on cover besided the cute little bird. The girl grabs the book and goes happly to find her mom. When the mom looks at the book her face is in shock. What would you do if that was your daughter? Most likely we'd put the book back and explain why she can't have it. While, others would go screaming to the check out and asking, 'how is it possible that my daughter got this? Shouldn't the libraries be wacthing the kids to make sure they don't go in that section?'. I believe that certain materials, such as books,movies, ect., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact people will still find way to get the removed material and that it's just a part of life. My first reason that certain materials, such as books, shouldn't be pulled from are shelves is that we live in a nation that prides it's self as the '@CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. That doesn't mean we get everything for @CAPS2 when we go to a store it just simple means that you, the people of @LOCATION1, have the freedom and right to speak your mind. So you can say whatever you want in newspapers or in books because the government gives you that right. However, you can't say 'I have a bomb' at the airports because of the many attacks the nation has encountered over the years, but that's common sences. My second reason that certain materials should say on the put, even if someone is offened by it is that no matter how many books or movies you take of the store shelves, the people will find a way to get them. One way to get them is the black market where people sell drugs and weapons. Do we, as a country really need another drug on the market even if it's a book? I think not. Also, if you look at the whole picture people will be losing jobs because the televison today is not the kind they had back in your grandma's day. Nearly @PERCENT1 of everything on televison has something to do with the little three letter s-word every parent hates to talk about. You might be thinking that if we take the unrated movies and the books with the naked men on the cover we'd be saving are children which leads me to my last point. Seeing unrated movies and such is a part of life. So what are you saving them from? Children sooner or later will grow up and learn about the types of subject matter so why take it off when you will have to teach them about it sooner rather then later? Millions of parents around the @CAPS3 each and every year have to teach their kids about the birds and the bees. It's a part of growing up in a way. Now a days though, the birds and the bees are all people seem to talk about. So like it or not your kids will find out just like you did and your parents before you. Plus, your not going to make everyone happy. Someone will always be offened by something. Imagine. Imagine that same little girl, now an adult, having to deal with that same issue of the same baby blue book with the same little bird with the half naked man on the cover. The truth is that this way my mother when she was little and it turns out that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree because I had the same issue as well. I know that one day I will also have the same issue as my mother did before me. So I believe that certain materials, such as books and movies, shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact that people will still find a way to get the removed material and that it's just apart of life.

The media should be for everyone to enjoy and not have to worry about offensive material. In @DATE1's world there are offensive media out there and they often start up problems. We need to do something about this problem. If there are offensive media out there the kids of the future are going to look up to them and try to be like them or hate the same thing that the media does. Let's just say there was a song about school and how people dont like it don't you think our kids are going to hate school too? I don't think that is right. We need to teach our kids that school is very important and not to take in what the media says because they are not always right. We want enjoyable media in the world. We want good things for our future kids to see and hear. We don't want kids picking up bad words. We need to watch what we put out in the world. If there is something offensive remove it from the shelves as soon as possible or just not put it out to the public at all. Offensive media can often start up problems in the world. Weither it's in the @CAPS2.S or somewhere around the world. If a book talks about how bad a certain race is those people that were disliked in the book are going to get even with the people who made the book or other media. Many issues @DATE1 are over media out there in the world. People that work at libraries should keep an eye out for offensive materals and shoud remove them to prevent even more problems. I'm sure libraries all around the world have some kind of offensive media in it. We need to stand up and fight to get rid of all offensive media and make the world a better place.

Truth be told, there are many ways for our offspring to not have the availability of those books. There is what I believe to be an appropriate division on the materials in our libraries and bookstores, the fact that we can always monitor what our children read and watch, and not to mention that we can use the internet to back up any doubts we have on the literature and lyrics.The question that remains is: Are we using the ways of preventing this problem to the best of our abilities? I believe that our public libraries and bookstores do a splendid job of diviying up what is deemed appropriate for each age group. Teens know a fairly good amount more about things than all parents invision they shouldn't, and I think the bookstores and libraries keep the youths knowledge in what they're listening, watching, and reading to what these kids already know. Comparing what is considered a 'young adult' book and an 'adult' book, you will find an atrocious difference. Young adult books only hint around things such as drugs, refraining from abstinence, and grisly murder scenes whereas adult books go into a great deal more detail. Middle school level children's books are even more less detailed than teen books, so it is save to say that as long as the parents are directing their child into the appropriate section in anyone's given local library, they will be in good hands. There's also the option of monitering what our young ones are listening to. By simply being interested in what it is that the child is singing or humming along to, us parents would find that they wouldn't be reluctant to let on about what was being said. If in any case we feel that the lyrics are too harsh for the kid, we are still their parents and have the right to deem it as something they shouldn't be listening to and suggest something different to them and/or ban them from being able to listen. In @CAPS1 cases though, we should try to listen to what our kids are. In this way, we can be reassured that the range of materials they're plugging into their ears are not what we would consider to be grotesque for something our children's age. Another useful tool would have to be the internet. If we don't feel the need to ask about the literature or music, but @MONTH1 still have a few doubts, there are plenty of book and music blogs across the world wide web that can help us out. Even by going to a bookstore website and reading the description about the book, or a lyric website that will tell us what is being said, or even a movie website where we can see a rating and the content of the movie, and the comments left by people that go with it respectively, @CAPS1 of us would find all of the information we need. Even author's, director's, and artist's websites would be useful. Looking at their discussions would be a big help as well, considering that @CAPS1 of these people have a vision of what age groups would be attracted to their material. In conclusion, I think our children are fairly wise about what they choose to read, listen to, and watch, but then again, it all depends on the preference. Not every child is the same, just as not any adult, or any one person. The prefernce tends to lean towards the things we think are appropriate. Paying attention to what the young ones are like says alot about what they read, and what they listen to and watch, for that matter. We have all these ways of keeping our children from reading, watching and listening to inappropriate things, we just have to make them and asset\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 486:\n","Essay Text: For many years libraries have had books, magazines, and movies posted in their shelves of the library that are very offensive to many people. Many people ask how is it ok for that censorship to be open to teenagers and possibly children. In my opinion I think that it is not right for libraries not to do anything about this problem, especially when this is happening across the nation. In large department stores such as @ORGANIZATION1, you are required to be eighteen years old to purchase adult items, sometimes you must be twenty-one years of age. It is considered illegal for anyone under the required age to purchase an item with an age limit on it. Music is a totally different type of profanity, @CAPS1 albums are sold with much innapropiate material in them that is open to the public, but the @CAPS1's sold in stores are usually edited into a more appropiate version. Days like today nearly no one ever buys @CAPS1's anymore, its all about @CAPS4's and @NUM1's where all you have to do is find your song on a site and download it for free in about four to five seconds. It would not surprise me if libraries had music and @CAPS1's with just as much adult profanity, and language that is not edited out. So if most of the things in this world that are adult rated and can not be purchased unless your considered an adult by age, why should it be ok to viewed by any age in a library. I myself believe that it should be illegal for materials such as the ones mentioned to be banned or atleast taken more respected with the viewer of the materials. It would really hurt a parent for them to take a kid to a library and tell them to go find a book they like, and they return to their mother or father with an adult book with many things a child or possibly a teenager should not see. I believe times like those could tear a parent or even a grandparent apart, having to explain to their children or grandchildren what they just saw. Because most of us know that most children always want to know what something is when they see it, and for a parent to have to explain to their child at that age has to be heart-stopping. In all of this that I have explained is only my opinion, but I believe many other millions of people agree with me. If it is not aloud almost everywhere else in this world, why should it be ok a library to do it? Is it because its some little rule about freedom of decision? Do libraries think just because they are old fashioned and have been here longer than the @CAPS1's, @CAPS4's, and @NUM1's that they dont have to follow rules and guidelines. It is a shame that they are ruining the lives and visions of the children and teens today to think its ok for anyone to see, listen, or watch these materials.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 487:\n","Essay Text: There are many books in the libraries.

Others relare to home issuse where they involve abuse. There are also book that are on bullying. These should be removed because children can read them and start bullying other children.

I say no that the books, music, movies, or magazines should not be removed from libraries, because if the books or etc. are that offensive, those things shouldn't censorship in childrens reach anyway. There should be a section limit where children can't go by to get to the offensive type books and others. Why take things that older people would insist on looking at off the shelf just because someone didn't separate the adult books and etc., from the childrens. Taking away the things that adults look at would be just as bad as taking the things that children or teens would like such as the music and movies, even though the music sometimes influnce some children to do bad or get off track from being who they really are. I don't understand why take those type things down when you are getting benefits off the things that people buy that will help keep libraries open such as fun rasier type. If you don't have things in a library that will capture a young persons attention like the movies, music, or magazines then children or teens will not be interested on going to libraries. Adults nor teens will sit in a library with under age books, movies, or music. Reason being is, becuase they are muture and not exactly looking for a book with lots of pictures and cartoons unless they are reading to an under age sibling. When that child has to go to library with his or her parent for example to do a project that parent would rather not just sit and wait the whole time for his or her child to finish. That is where the magazines come in ; magazines are very interesting books such as @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS2 @CAPS3 those magazines occupy peoples time while they are waiting just like any other places. Everywhere you go children are going to see things that they shouldn't see at their age, because television and the internet has so many componets that will cause a distraction to a childs mind that will make them question everything they see. That child will soon have to learn. That is how most children are becoming so blunt with the things they do or say, because either they seen it or heard it. I know you @MONTH1 think that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves to keep out of reach of children, but I think that if you are able to separate all upper age group books, movies, music, magazines from all children and other young adults, the library would become more beneficial to everyone that has access to a local library.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 489:\n","Essay Text: I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Materials should not be offensive in any way to chilren, or any human censorship Now, I will tell the many readers that will read this article what I think should be and what should not be on the shelf. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories, should teach lessons, and should not be offensive. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories. When I sit down to read a book or magazine, or to watch a movie, I want to read or watch an interesting story. A little child is not going to want to read a book about history or science, they will want to read about @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @LOCATION2, or @ORGANIZATION1. Children will not sit still unless they have something to read or watch that is interesting and appealing to them. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should teach lessons. I believe that libraries should have books, magazines, etc., that teach them how to tie their shoes, to count, or to say the alphabet. Children love to sing, so simply put a @CAPS3 in that sings the alphabet, and the child will be singing along shortly. When a child pulls a book off of the shelf at a library, that shows a pretty picture, the child will be attracted to it, and learn as they read or watch. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be offensive. Kids should not read a book, magazine, etc., if the author is talking about harming someone or something. If the book, magazine, etc., has inappropriate language or insult someone, that book needs to be taken off of the shelf and immediately thrown in the trash. The last thing a parent wants is their child to learn something bad from a book and repeat it at school, because that will only lead up to the child getting in serious trouble. Again, I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be banned from the shelves if they are found offensive. Parents do not want to get a phone call from the schoool principal saying their child is using inappropriate language, or being offensive to others. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell wonderful stories, should teach children things that will help them in school, and should not say harmful things about someone or something. Children can learn so much from books, music, movies, magazines, etc., so why make them say offensive or disrespectful things?\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 490:\n","Essay Text: Censorship In Libraries Do you believe that certain marerials such as books, music movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if found offensive?

There are just to many views on what is explicit to discern between censorship should be allowed, and what should be expunged. In many cases libraries have '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' in which books, that the majority of people would consider explicit, are held. These @CAPS2 are normally closed off and a person has to exert some sort of physical motion through a barrier in order to enter, therefore they are in full knowledge that there @MONTH1 be offensive literature there. One also must take into account the meaning of the term '@CAPS3 @CAPS4'. That term has a key phrase in the title, @CAPS3, which is almost a warning in itself that the literature in it @MONTH1 be offensive to someone. These points show that there should be no restriction on the books, magazines or music in @CAPS3 libraries. The first topic of discussion is the definition of obscene. There are @NUM1 billion people, in the @LOCATION1 alone, that all have their own views of what they consider obscene to be. If one asked an avid conservative their thoughts on obscenity, they would differ by a tremendous amount of those that a free-spirited individual would have. The inconsistency of views is an obvious reason to keep all types of books in libraries. Not only that but also the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 allows libraries to put grossly obscene literature in a hidden, but accessible area. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are made for one purpose, to sheild the general @CAPS3 of things that would be seen by the majority as obscene. These @CAPS2 are not out in the open where anyone can stumble upon them, they are usually in a corner of the @CAPS4, closed off, and marked '@CAPS1'. These @CAPS2 allow a little bit of compromise between the two sides of the debate for censorship, by still allowing all types of literature, but also sheilding anyone from seeing or hearing any of it unpurposefully. Because of these @CAPS2 there is no way anyone could complain about obscenity in the general @CAPS4 setting. For the libraries without @CAPS1 @CAPS2, there is the warning on the door of the @CAPS4, the word @CAPS3. @CAPS3 libraries are intended for the @CAPS3. Walking into one, under ones own power, dispells any complaints one would have about obscenity. This is because the act of entering a @CAPS3 @CAPS4, puts one in the atmosphere of the @CAPS4, whatever it @MONTH1 be. Libraries should not be held responsible for whether or not the literature on their shelves is offensive. The word @CAPS3 in the term @CAPS3 @CAPS4 is, like said previously, a warning of its own, letting anyone know who is entering that there is a chance there @MONTH1 be some things that person could precieve as obscene. This and multiple other reasons put to rest any thought one would have about removing certain literature from libraries. The three reasons given, along with the many more out there left unsaid, make it inevitable that libraries are not ment to be censored. The fact that the word obscene can not be tailored to fit everyone's personal views, the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and the word @CAPS3 placed infront of @CAPS4, warning everyone any type of literature could be in said @CAPS4, are enough to disspell any thought of censoring libraries. Underground bunkers were designed to sheild and censor the @CAPS3, not libraries.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 492:\n","Essay Text: Bad @CAPS1 Should be Removed I think that they schould be taken off of the shelves in libraries.

Absolutely, there are many books, magazines, and music selections that should have never reached the shelf. Life has many choices. The people of this world have a choice on what they read or censorship to. At a young age we are taught right from wrong. Everyone has different rights and many different wrongs, that they are taught by their parents. It is those morals we our taught that help us decide what we should listen to or what we shoud read. I am a high school student that is very aware of right or wrong. Though my choices @MONTH1 not show as much. I am very aware of what I read and put into my head. Who wants to have certain magazine sex stories in their head? Not me, thats for sure! That makes any guy a perverse guy. I don't read books the tell me how to get in a girl's pants, that is wrong and I belive that should be censored. As a high school guy looking at a girl can be tough on some and then deciding to read about how to get a girl only encourages those types of attitudes. It is the exact same for girls too. Reading wrong stuff puts it into your head. What goes in your head comes out. Music is very influential in todays world. Rap for instence talks about money, sex, and drugs. Like I said garbage in is garbage out. Rap does have a good side too, all music does it is just an example. Then you have rockstars that do the exact same thing. All music depending on the genre you listen to, does say a lot about the person he/ or she is. Christen music does not need to be censored, because it is positive and up-lifting. Not all songs on the radio need to be censored either. Yes the ones talking about sex, drugs, and other terrible things need to be censored. Why would you want to put that stuff in your head? It makes no sense if that is who you want to be, a unintellegent person that no one likes, due to your moods. Movies could do without all the vulgar language and the sex scenes. Movies are meant to be enjoyed. Movies recently have not been family oriented. Transformers for example is a go out with your friends movie. The @CAPS1 series should never have been created. The person that made the @CAPS1 series has a very dark and twisted mind. Scary movies have a purpose for @CAPS3 and other festivities. Scary or not it should have less sex scenes. You should not have to worry what your child is going to see if he/ or she goes out to the movies with friends. Movies play a big part in our economy and that means many adults, teenagers, and children our watching something that is or is not good for their mind and well-being, but movies still have positive impact, jsut depends on what your watching. It is very obvious that our society has different views on, if things should be censored or not. People have their own lifes to lead and live, it is their right to decide what is right and what is wrong. Books, music, and movies influence our society in many ways. Yes some things need to be censored, because music and movies are making some things socially acceptable. When growing up not all things are socially acceptable, or so we are taught. Schools should not censor many books or our music selections, because it is high school it is when we discover ourselves. It is the morals that we are taught that define us, and what we learn from those morals of what is right or wrong to; read, listen to, or watch, that is what builds us as people to grow. You put garbage in your morals with what you do, you are only going to get garbage out\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 4\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 4\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 494:\n","Essay Text: During my freshman year there was a lot of controversy over whether or not the classes should be allowed to read 'The @ORGANIZATION1' in school. The debate was due to the fact that there is a rape scene in the book, censorship many people find too innappropriate for freshman to be reading about. However, it seems to me that we are exposed to offensive things every day and it is not plausible to simply censor every innappropriate thing we come across. In terms of censorship in libraries, it is outlandish to think that we could do the same thing. When people visit libraries, they are there to check out books that they want to read. While there @MONTH1 be many forms of offensive media avaliable to the public through the library, that doesn't mean that people are obligated to view them. We are all perfectly capable of choosing for ourselves what we put into our minds. Because the media advertises offensive things all the time, we cannot block out everything. However we can chose what it is that we want to read when we visit the library. Since it is a choice, it shouldn't be necessary to censor everything there because you don't have to chose to view it. Censorship is also very subjective. What is deemed offensive to someone, @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else. If we oblige to sensor everything anyone claims to be offensive, there would no longer be any forms of media left. This is much like the quote from Katherine Paterson, where she says, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We rid the libraries of what each person finds offensive and what do you have left? Being around things we find offensive is, sadly, a part of life. That does not mean that we have engage in such things. It will never get to a point where everyone is completely happy with the way things are being censored unless everything is done away with, and that would only bring about new issues. We have to have the self control to provide censorship for ourselves, we cannot leave that job to other people.\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","##################################\n","PREDICTION- Essay 495:\n","Essay Text: I believe, an artist has the rights to his/her music being sold.

Cause if you don't want your child to listen,read,watch. Then take a big boy/girl pill and take charge. You can whin and pull a fit all you want. But, really what good is it going to do.

But in the long run they will realize you made those choices for them is cause you cared. So personally I really don't think its the music's fault or movies,magazines,etc. I think its the way those kids are rised in their household, that impacts the choices they make. Heres an example, I saw this really awesome video game that I wanted once. But my dad said no. Cause its language and themes were bad. At first I thought I hated my dad. But now I'm glad I didn't buy it. Cause what good would a video game do in the long run. Will it pay bills? No it won't. Will it bring food to the table? No it won't. Will it help you get married? No I think not. The point is the choices made now is what is going to effect you in the long run. I really think its choice. If you make the choice of buying a movie or book,music etc.With that kind of offensive behavior. Then, thats how your representing youself to others around you.

Absolutely! I believe we should, at least for the children. There are some pretty bad things out there that I do not believe are quite appropriate for children, or even teenagers. If I were a parent, there are censorship things I would not let my child read or look at. If we don't even give them a chance to see them, then we wouldn't have to worry. Chidren these day are not what they used to be. What would their great grandparents think if they saw the way today's adolescents act, dress, and even talk? Where do you think they get this from? The answer is simple. They get it from today's movies, books, music, and magazines. We cannot keep going on like this or eventually we will have toddlers acting inappropriately! I know from experience that when children are small and they see or hear something, it sticks with them for a long time. If child is looking through a magazine and they see a questionable picture, they are not likely to forget that picture very soon. Or if they are listening to a song with bad words, don't be surprised if they do not forget them or even start repeating them. That is just how small children are. My last point is the fact that parents would probably be much happier if offensive material was removed from libraries. Parents would be able to bring their children to the library and not have to worry about what they are looking at or listening to. The children would feel a sense of freedom and the parents would, in return, feel a sense of reassurance. Offensive material should definitely be removed from our libraries in order to keep our children pure and their parents happy. I understand that others would argue that if we take out offensive material then eventually, there would be nothing left for our children to read.

No one should be allowed to check out a book unless the are old enough for the catorgie they are checking out. This is my view on how libraries should be set up. I think by doing this it would keeps the younger children away from books that might be offensive to them. I do not think that books that some people find offensive should be taken off the shelfs, because they might not be offensive to other people\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 1: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 1: 3\n","\n","Actual Score    - Domain 2: 1\n","Predicted Score - Domain 2: 3\n","\n","X INCORRECT INCORRECT\n","\n","#########################################################\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"JIF1NdxTgF84","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
