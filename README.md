------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extract the .zip and upload /StatNLP/... folder and all its files and sub-folders into Google drive
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pre-requisites:
All libraries are required as listed below.

Python 3.7.3
Google Colab
Keras 1.14.0
Tensorflow 2.0 
Anaconda 3
Jupyter Notebook 
Matplotlib
Numpy 
Pandas
GloVe Embedding Vector sets (by Stanford University) must be downloaded into Data set/GloVe

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 1 - Creating a Dual Scoring CNN system, as a Black Box to test.
Open 
 - Blacbox.ipynb file 
using Google Colab and set the notebox mode into "Blackbox Training" and execute all cells

Part 2 - Generating Adversarial Attacks.
Load  
 - ADVERSARIAL-ATTACK-GENERATOR.ipynb
 - AnchorModel.ipynb and 
 using Goolge Colab and execute all cells.
(Please note Anchor model takes in terms of hrs to run, so be patient to get results)

Part 3 - Applying the attacks, and evaluating the results.**
Open 
 - Blackbox.ipynb file using Google Colab and set the notebox mode into "Adversarial Testing" and execute all cells.
